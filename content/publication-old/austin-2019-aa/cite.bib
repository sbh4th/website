 abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To build a longitudinal state-level database on targeted regulation of abortion providers (TRAP) laws.
DATA SOURCES: Primary sources included state websites, Lexis Nexis Quicklaw, and WestlawNext. We used a range of secondary sources to pinpoint policy timing.
STUDY DESIGN: This was a state-level review of TRAP shifts from 1973 to present.
DATA COLLECTION: We captured data on TRAP policy activity and timing, focusing specifically on ambulatory surgical center (ASC) laws, admitting privilege requirements, and transfer agreements.
PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Twenty-five states had ever enacted an ASC, admitting privilege, or transfer agreement law. Many currently face legal challenges.
CONCLUSIONS: Targeted regulation of abortion providers laws are favored by many states as a way to regulate abortion provision. These data can be used to better understand the impact of these laws.},
