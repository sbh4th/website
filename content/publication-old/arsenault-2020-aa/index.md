abstract: "BACKGROUND: Beyond the prevention of illness and death, vaccination may\
  \ provide additional benefits such as improved educational outcomes. However, there\
  \ is currently little evidence on this question. Our objective was to estimate the\
  \ effect of childhood vaccination on learning achievements among primary school\
  \ children in India. METHODS: We used cohort data from the India Human Development\
  \ Survey. Vaccination status and confounders were measured among children who were\
  \ at least 12 months old at baseline in 2004-2005. In 2011-2012, the same children\
  \ completed basic reading, writing and math tests. We estimated the effect of full\
  \ vaccination during childhood on learning achievements using inverse probability\
  \ of treatment-weighted logistic regression models and results reported on the risk\
  \ difference scale. The propensity score included 33 potential community-, household-,\
  \ mother- and child-level confounders as well as state fixed effects. RESULTS: Among\
  \ the 4877 children included in our analysis, 54% were fully vaccinated at baseline,\
  \ and 54% could read by the age of 8-11 years. The estimated effect of full vaccination\
  \ on learning achievements ranged from 4 to 6 percentage points, representing relative\
  \ increases ranging from 6% to 12%. Bias analysis suggested that our observed effects\
  \ could be explained by unmeasured confounding, but only in the case of strong associations\
  \ with the treatment and outcome. CONCLUSION: These results support the hypothesis\
  \ that vaccination has lasting effects on children's learning achievements. Further\
  \ work is needed to confirm findings and elucidate the potential mechanisms linking\
  \ vaccines to educational outcomes."
