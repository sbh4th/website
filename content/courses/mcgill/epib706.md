## Course Description
EPIB 706 is a PhD-level seminar aimed at providing space for students to engage with overarching concepts critical to the theory and practice of epidemiology, as well to explore recent controversies and debates in the field. The purpose of this course is not to equip you with any marketable skill; rather, it is to reinforce your formal coursework by making space to develop and sharpen your critical thinking skills. We will review a selection of papers that range across methods, principles, arguments, and debates in epidemiology and the wider scientific community. 

## Eligibility
Registration in the PhD program in Epidemiology and successful completion of the  course sequence in epidemiologic methods (EPIB 704 and EPIB 705) is required. Students who have not completed EPIB 704 and EPIB 705 must obtain the instructor's permission to take the course.

## Course Format
This is a discussion-based course and this year, due to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, it will be held remotely until further notice. We are all here to learn from one another, and this course simply won't work without engagement and participation from all of us (including me). Of course, everyone has their own level of comfort speaking up, as well as varying levels of interest in some of these topics, so I have no expectation that everyone participates equally. What I do ask is that you make a sincere effort to engage with the material, both in terms of the reading and in the discussion forum. Learning how to respectfully express your opinion about conceptual and methodological issues is a core part of being a scientist.

## Evaluation
### Written Assignments
The discussions in the course are meant to activate your critical thinking skills, and to encourage you to synthesize your own thoughts on the material, particularly as it may relate to your area of research interest. Toward that end, over the course of the semester you will be asked to submit **two** critical essays that explore a topic of relevance to epidemiologic science.These may be direct responses to material that we read or discuss in class, or they may be essays exploring other topics relevant to your work that demonstrate good-faith efforts to engage with the class material. These should take the form of a commentary similar (in spirit) to those we have read during the semester, and should be no longer than 1500 words. The first one is due on **October 22, 2020** and the second one is due on **December 7, 2020**. I will provide examples of what I think are good pieces of writing to aspire to. 

### Class Participation
In addition to the writing assignment, each student will be asked to lead **one** day of discussion among the topics that we will cover. For that session, you will come prepared to *briefly* summarize the material we have read, and to prepare some discussion points to help keep the conversation moving. I have created a Google spreadsheet with the current days for each topic here. Please sign-up for a session and we can have a discussion about the readings and where to draw on other resources for the topic.

## Grading
The course is pass-fail.

## Reading
The assigned readings are the core of the course material, and students are expected to carefully and critically read each assignment *before* class. To facilitate student engagement with the reading we will use the online tool [Perusall](http://perusall.com) for all required readings. Perusall is a reading platform in which students annotate texts collaboratively alongside one another. More information on how Perusall works and how it is integrated into the course is available [here](https://asuonline.wistia.com/medias/dvaftxxad7) (thank you Arizona State!). To access Perusall through MyCourses, navigate to Content > Perusall
(readings) > Perusall, and then click the "Open Link" button. This will take you to the Perusall site and automatically register you as a member of the course. If you are having any trouble accessing the readings through Perusall contact me right away. I will not be using Perusall's grading features, but I expect you to read, post questions, respond to other students questions and answers, and to take an active role in generating productive discussion.

## A Note About Class Participation
Participation means showing up for each class having read and engaged with the material assigned. It will help facilitate discussion if you could aim to contribute at least 2-3 points for discussion in Perusall, and bring those to class. During the discussion period in class participation means asking questions about anything in the readings that seems unclear or objectionable, offering respectful arguments and responses, and respectfully listening to the arguments and responses of others. Contributions should be relevant and helpful and demonstrate that you are engaging with the material being discussed at the time, and that you are well-prepared for class.

## Course Outline (12 "questions" to consider)
A note about the outline. In an effort to make this course as dynamic and helpful to students as possible, the list of topics and reading below is subject to change. Enthusiasm (or lack thereof) for certain topics may lead us to revise, drop, add, or replace some readings or entire topics as we go. I promise to entertain any changes or suggestions, but may also disagree if I feel certain topics or readings are too important to replace.
