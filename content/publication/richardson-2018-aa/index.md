abstract: "Access to affordable daycare might improve population mental health. However,\
  \ evidence is sparse and restricted to middle- and high-income country settings.\
  \ We conducted a cluster-randomized controlled trial in one low-income setting,\
  \ rural Rajasthan, India. Communities lacking daycare facilities were identified\
  \ (n = 160) and randomly selected for assistance in setting up a community-based\
  \ daycare program (n = 80) or not (n = 80). Women eligible for the daycare program\
  \ living in these communities completed structured interviews before the intervention\
  \ (participation rate = 89%) and approximately one year after rollout of the intervention\
  \ (participation rate = 96%), resulting in a final analytic sample of 3041. Mental\
  \ distress was measured with the Hindi version of the 12-item General Health Questionnaire\
  \ (score range: 0-12). We modeled the relation between access to daycare and number\
  \ of mental distress symptoms (GHQ-12 score) with negative binomial regression using\
  \ an intention-to-treat approach, which groups women according to if they lived\
  \ in communities randomized to affordable daycare. We also evaluated the effect\
  \ of access to daycare on secondary outcomes that may be related to mental distress,\
  \ including women's work burden, agency, and intimate partner violence (IPV). We\
  \ found that access to daycare resulted in modest reductions in symptoms of mental\
  \ distress (mean difference = 0.21, 95% CI: -0.43, 0.02). We found some evidence\
  \ that daycare reduced IPV, but virtually no change in women's work burden or agency.\
  \ Our results provide some indication that access to affordable daycare might be\
  \ one policy lever to improve population mental health."
