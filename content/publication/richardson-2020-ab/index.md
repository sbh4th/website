abstract: "PURPOSE: Intimate partner violence (IPV) encompasses physical, sexual,\
  \ and psychological abuse, as well as controlling behavior. Most research focuses\
  \ on physical and sexual abuse, and other aspects of IPV are rarely investigated.\
  \ We estimated the effect of these neglected aspects of IPV on women's mental distress.\
  \ METHODS: We used data from 3010 women living in rural tribal communities in Rajasthan,\
  \ India. Women completed baseline interviews and were re-interviewed approximately\
  \ 1.5 years later. We measured IPV with questions adopted from the Demographic and\
  \ Health Survey's Domestic Violence Module, which asked seven questions about physical\
  \ abuse, three questions about psychological abuse, and five questions about partner\
  \ controlling behavior. Mental distress was measured with the 12-item General Health\
  \ Questionnaire (score range 0-12). We used Poisson regression models to estimate\
  \ the relation between changes in IPV and mental distress, accounting for time-fixed\
  \ characteristics of individuals using individual fixed effects. RESULTS: Women\
  \ reported an average of 2.1 distress symptoms during baseline interviews. In models\
  \ that controlled for time-varying confounding (e.g., wealth, other types of abuse),\
  \ experiencing psychological abuse was associated with an increase of 0.65 distress\
  \ symptoms (95% CI 0.32, 0.98), and experiencing controlling behavior was associated\
  \ with an increase of 0.31 distress symptoms (95% CI 0.18, 0.44). However, experiencing\
  \ physical abuse was not associated with an increase in distress symptoms (mean\
  \ difference = - 0.15, 95% CI - 0.45, 0.15). CONCLUSIONS: Psychological abuse and\
  \ controlling behavior may be important drivers of the relation between IPV and\
  \ women's mental health."
