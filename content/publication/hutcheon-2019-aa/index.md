abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Meta-analyses of observational studies have shown that women
  with a shorter interpregnancy interval (the time from delivery to start of a subsequent
  pregnancy) are more likely to experience adverse pregnancy outcomes, such as preterm
  delivery or small for gestational age birth, than women who space their births further
  apart. However, the studies used to inform these estimates have methodological shortcomings.
  METHODS: In this commentary, we summarise the discussions of an expert workgroup
  describing good practices for the design, analysis, and interpretation of observational
  studies of interpregnancy interval and adverse perinatal health outcomes. RESULTS:
  We argue that inferences drawn from research in this field will be improved by careful
  attention to elements such as: (a) refining the research question to clarify whether
  the goal is to estimate a causal effect vs describe patterns of association; (b)
  using directed acyclic graphs to represent potential causal networks and guide the
  analytic plan of studies seeking to estimate causal effects; (c) assessing how miscarriages
  and pregnancy terminations may have influenced interpregnancy interval classifications;
  (d) specifying how key factors such as previous pregnancy loss, pregnancy intention,
  and maternal socio-economic position will be considered; and (e) examining if the
  association between interpregnancy interval and perinatal outcome differs by factors
  such as maternal age. CONCLUSION: This commentary outlines the discussions of this
  recent expert workgroup, and describes several suggested principles for study design
  and analysis that could mitigate many potential sources of bias.'
