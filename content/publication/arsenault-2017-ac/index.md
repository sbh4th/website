abstract: 'OBJECTIVES: (1) To conduct a systematic analysis of inequalities in childhood
  vaccination coverage in Gavi-supported countries; (2) to comparatively assess alternative
  measurement approaches and how they may affect cross-country comparisons of the
  level of inequalities. METHODS: Using the most recent Demographic and Health Surveys
  (2005-2014) in 45 Gavi-supported countries, we measured inequalities in vaccination
  coverage across seven dimensions of social stratification and of vulnerability to
  poor health outcomes. We quantified inequalities using pairwise comparisons (risk
  differences and ratios) and whole spectrum measures (slope and relative indices
  of inequality). To contrast measurement approaches, we pooled the estimates using
  random-effects meta-analyses, ranked countries by the magnitude of inequality and
  compared agreement in country ranks. RESULTS: At the aggregate level, maternal education,
  multidimensional poverty, and wealth index poverty were the dimensions associated
  with the largest inequalities. In 36 out of 45 countries, inequalities were substantial,
  with a difference in coverage of 10 percentage points or more between the top and
  bottom of at least one of these social dimensions. Important inequalities by child
  sex, child malnutrition and urban/rural residence were also found in a smaller set
  of countries. The magnitude of inequality and ranking of countries differed across
  dimension and depending on the measure used. Pairwise comparisons could not be estimated
  in certain countries. The slope and relative indices of inequality were estimated
  in all countries and produced more stable country rankings, and should thus facilitate
  more reliable international comparisons. CONCLUSIONS: Inequalities in vaccination
  coverage persist in a large majority of Gavi-supported countries. Inequalities should
  be monitored across multiple dimensions of vulnerability. Using whole spectrum measures
  to quantify inequality across multiple ordered social groups has important advantages.
  We illustrate these findings using an equity dashboard designed to support decision-making
  in the Sustainable Development Goals period.'
