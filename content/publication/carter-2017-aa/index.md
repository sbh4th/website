abstract: The Family Medicine Group (FMG) model of primary care in Quebec, Canada,
  was driven by the voluntary implementation of family physicians. Our main objective
  was to measure the effect of FMG enrolment on avoidable use of the emergency department
  (ED) by diabetic patients. We also sought to determine if effects differed according
  to whether patients were infrequent or frequent users of the ED and according to
  high- versus low-regional levels of enrolment. We used data from provincial health
  administrative databases to identify the diabetic patient population over the age
  of 20 years for each fiscal year between 2003-2004 and 2011-2012. We used fixed
  effects and marginal structural models to estimate the effect of enrolment in FMGs
  on avoidable use of the ED. Our results indicated that for every 10-percentage point
  increase in the population enrolled with an FMG in the year prior to an event, there
  was a 3% reduction in avoidable visits to the ED made by an individual (RR = 0.97;
  95% CI = 0.95, 0.99). We found a significant reduction among diabetic patients who
  had at most 1 visit to the ED per year (RR = 0.97; 95% CI = 0.95, 0.99) and nonsignificant
  effects among more frequent users. Within low-enrolment regions, a 10-percentage
  point increase in enrolment in FMG practices at t - 1 led to an 18% decrease in
  the number of avoidable ED visits (RR = 0.82; 95% CI = 0.78, 0.87). The effect disappeared
  when the analyses were restricted to the high-enrolment regions (RR = 1.00; 95%
  CI = 0.92, 1.09). The design and implementation of the incentive to promote team-based
  practice may not have borne much influence on early adopters who may have been overrepresented
  by physicians from high-performing practices before the introduction of the reform.
