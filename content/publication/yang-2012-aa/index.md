abstract: Women live much longer than men in Korea, with remarkable gains in life
  expectancy at birth for the past decades. The gender differential has steadily increased
  over time, reaching a peak of more than 8 years in 1980s, and decreased thereafter
  to 6.7 years in 2005. Studies to investigate the pattern and contributing factors
  to changes in the life expectancy gender gap have been mostly from Western countries,
  and there has been no such study in Asian countries, except in Japan. We therefore
  aimed to examine age- and cause-specific contributions to the changing gender differentials
  in life expectancy in Korea, in particular the decline of the gap, using a decomposition
  method. Between 1970 and 1979 when the gender gap in life expectancy widened, faster
  mortality decline among women in ages 20-44 explained 66% of the total increase
  in the gender gap, which would be due to substantial improvements in reproductive
  health among women and excess male mortality in occupational injuries and transport
  accidents. Although greater survival advantage among elderly women over 70 contributed
  to further increase in the gender gap, the contributions from younger ages with
  the ages 15-64 contributing the most (-2 years) resulted in the overall reduction
  of the gender gap which began in 1992 and continued to 2005. Among causes of death,
  liver diseases (-0.5 years, 38% of the total decline), transport accidents (-0.4
  years, 31%), hypertensive diseases (-0.3 years, 19%), stroke (-0.1 years, 11%),
  and tuberculosis (-0.1 years) contributed the most to the overall 1.4 years reduction
  in the gender gap. However, changes in mortality from lung cancer (+0.3 years),
  suicide (+0.3 years), chronic lower respiratory diseases (+0.2 years), and ischemic
  heart diseases (+0.1 years) contributed to widening the gap during the same period.
  In sum, while smoking-related causes of death have contributed most to the narrowing
  gap in most other industrialized countries, these causes contributed toward increasing
  the gender gap in Korea. Instead, liver disease, hypertension-related diseases,
  and transport accidents were major contributing causes of death to the narrowing
  of gender differentials in life expectancy in Korea.
