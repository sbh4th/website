abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Racial residential segregation in the United States has been
  linked to racial differences in birth outcomes, with studies reporting associations
  between segregation and birth weight. However, this relationship is likely confounded,
  and many individual and neighborhood-level covariates included in previous models
  are likely mediators, potentially obscuring any causal impact of segregation on
  birth weight. METHODS: We compiled a record of non-Hispanic black and white singleton
  births to US-born/resident mothers in 2000, linked to segregation indices at the
  metropolitan statistical area (MSA) level in the non-Southern US. Segregation was
  measured via the dissimilarity index. The outcomes were individual-level birth weight
  and the metropolitan statistical area-level black/white gap in birth weight. We
  instrumented for segregation using the railroad division index. We compared race-stratified
  ordinary least squares models to two-stage least squares models, with cluster robust
  standard errors. RESULTS: We estimated a 1.2 g decrease in black birth weight for
  every one-percentage point increase in segregation (95% confidence interval [CI]:
  -1.9, -0.50) via ordinary least squares but a 2.8 g decrease (95% CI: -6.0, 0.48)
  using two-stage least squares. For white infants, our ordinary least squares estimate
  was 0.53 (95% CI: -0.23, 1.3), and our two-stage least squares estimate was in the
  opposite direction (-0.68, 95% CI: -3.5, 2.1). CONCLUSIONS: Ordinary least squares
  estimates may understate the effect of segregation on birth weight in blacks. Evidence
  from instrumental variable models was consistent with a causal impact of segregation
  on black birth outcomes, but estimates were imprecise and may be affected by weak
  instrument bias.'
