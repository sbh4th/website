abstract: 'OBJECTIVE: To measure trends in socioeconomic inequalities tobacco use
  in Nepal. SETTING: Adults interviewed during house-to-house surveys. PARTICIPANTS:
  Women (15-45 years) and men (15-49 years) surveyed in four Nepal Demographic and
  Health Surveys done in 2001, 2006, 2011 and 2016. OUTCOME MEASURE: Current tobacco
  use (in any form). RESULTS: The prevalence of tobacco use for men declined from
  66% in 2001 to 55% in 2016, and declined from 29% to 8.4% among women. Across both
  education and wealth quintiles for both men and women, the prevalence of tobacco
  use generally declines with increasing education or wealth. We found persistently
  larger absolute inequalities by education than by wealth among men. Among women
  we also found larger educational than wealth-related gradients, but both declined
  over time. For men, the Slope Index of Inequality (SII) for education was larger
  than for wealth (44% vs 26% in 2001) and changed very little over time. For women,
  the SII for both education and wealth were similar in magnitude to men, but decreased
  substantially between 2001 and 2016 (from 44% to 16% for education; from 37% to
  16% for wealth). Women had a larger relative index of inequality than men for both
  education (6.5 vs 2.0 in 2001) and wealth (4.8 vs 1.5 in 2001), and relative inequality
  increased between 2001 and 2016 for women (from 6.5 to 16.0 for education; from
  4.8 to 12.0 for wealth). CONCLUSION: Increasing relative inequalities indicates
  suboptimal reduction in tobacco use among the vulnerable groups suggesting that
  they should be targeted to improve tobacco control.'
