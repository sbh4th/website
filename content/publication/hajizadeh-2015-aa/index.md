abstract: 'The availability of maternity leave might remove barriers to improved vaccination
  coverage by increasing the likelihood that parents are available to bring a child
  to the clinic for immunizations. Using information from 20 low-and-middle-income
  countries (LMICs) we estimated the effect of paid maternity leave policies on childhood
  vaccination uptake. We used birth history data collected via Demographic and Health
  Surveys (DHS) to assemble a multilevel panel of 258,769 live births in 20 countries
  from 2001 to 2008; these data were merged with longitudinal information on the number
  of full-time equivalent (FTE) weeks of paid maternity leave guaranteed by each country.
  We used Logistic regression models that included country and year fixed effects
  to estimate the impact of increases in FTE paid maternity leave policies in the
  prior year on the receipt of the following vaccines: Bacillus Calmette-Gu√©rin (BCG)
  commonly given at birth, diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis (DTP, 3 doses) commonly
  given in clinic visits and Polio (3 doses) given in clinic visits or as part of
  campaigns. We found that extending the duration of paid maternity leave had a positive
  effect on immunization rates for all three doses of the DTP vaccine; each additional
  FTE week of paid maternity leave increased DTP1, 2 and 3 coverage by 1.38 (95% CI
  = 1.18, 1.57), 1.62 (CI = 1.34, 1.91) and 2.17 (CI = 1.76, 2.58) percentage points,
  respectively. Estimates were robust to adjustment for birth characteristics, household-level
  covariates, attendance of skilled health personnel at birth and time-varying country-level
  covariates. We found no evidence for an effect of maternity leave on the probability
  of receiving vaccinations for BCG or Polio after adjustment for the above-mentioned
  covariates. Our findings were consistent with the hypothesis that more generous
  paid leave policies have the potential to improve DTP immunization coverage. Further
  work is needed to understand the health effects of paid leave policies in LMICs. '
