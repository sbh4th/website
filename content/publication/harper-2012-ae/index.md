abstract: 'PURPOSE: To replicate a prior study that found greater adolescent marijuana
  use in states that have passed medical marijuana laws (MMLs), and extend this analysis
  by accounting for confounding by unmeasured state characteristics and measurement
  error. METHODS: We obtained state-level estimates of marijuana use from the 2002
  through 2009 National Survey on Drug Use and Health. We used 2-sample t-tests and
  random-effects regression to replicate previous results. We used difference-in-differences
  regression models to estimate the causal effect of MMLs on marijuana use, and simulations
  to account for measurement error. RESULTS: We replicated previously published results
  showing higher marijuana use in states with MMLs. Difference-in-differences estimates
  suggested that passing MMLs decreased past-month use among adolescents by 0.53 percentage
  points (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.03-1.02) and had no discernible effect on
  the perceived riskiness of monthly use. Models incorporating measurement error in
  the state estimates of marijuana use yielded little evidence that passing MMLs affects
  marijuana use. CONCLUSIONS: Accounting for confounding by unmeasured state characteristics
  and measurement error had an important effect on estimates of the impact of MMLs
  on marijuana use. We find limited evidence of causal effects of MMLs on measures
  of reported marijuana use.'
