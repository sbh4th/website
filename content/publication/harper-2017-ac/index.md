abstract: 'INTRODUCTION: Policies that allow directly citing motorists for seat belt
  non-use (primary enforcement) have been shown to reduce motor vehicle crash deaths
  relative to secondary enforcement, but the evidence base is dated and does not account
  for recent improvements in vehicle designs and road safety. The purpose of this
  study was to test whether recent upgrades to primary enforcement still reduce motor
  vehicle crash deaths. METHODS: In 2016, researchers used motor vehicle crash death
  data from the Fatal Analysis Reporting System for 2000-2014 and calculated rates
  using both person- and exposure-based denominators. Researchers used a difference-in-differences
  design to estimate the effect of primary enforcement on death rates, and estimated
  negative binomial regression models, controlling for age, substance use involvement,
  fixed state characteristics, secular trends, state median household income, and
  other state-level traffic safety policies. RESULTS: Models adjusted only for crash
  characteristics and state-level covariates models showed a protective effect of
  primary enforcement (rate ratio, 0.88, 95% CI=0.77, 0.98; rate difference, -1.47
  deaths per 100,000 population, 95% CI= -2.75, -0.19). After adjustment for fixed
  state characteristics and secular trends, there was no evidence of an effect of
  upgrading from secondary to primary enforcement in the whole population (rate ratio,
  0.98, 95% CI=0.92, 1.04; rate difference, -0.22, 95% CI= -0.90, 0.46) or for any
  age group. CONCLUSIONS: Upgrading to primary enforcement no longer appears protective
  for motor vehicle crash death rates.'
