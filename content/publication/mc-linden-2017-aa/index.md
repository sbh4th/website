abstract: 'Severe food insecurity (FI), which indicates reduced food intake, is common
  among HIV-hepatitis C virus (HCV) co-infected individuals. Given the importance
  of unemployment as a proximal risk factor for FI, this mediation analysis examines
  a potential mechanism through which injection drug use (IDU) is associated with
  severe FI. We used biannual data from the Canadian Co-infection Cohort (N = 429
  with 3 study visits, 2012-2015). IDU in the past 6 months (exposure) and current
  unemployment (mediator) were self-reported. Severe FI in the following 6 months
  (outcome) was measured using the Household Food Security Survey Module. An overall
  association and a controlled direct effect were estimated using marginal structural
  models. Among participants, 32% engaged in IDU, 78% were unemployed, and 29% experienced
  severe FI. After adjustment for confounding and addressing censoring through weighting,
  the overall association (through all potential pathways) between IDU and severe
  FI was: risk ratio (RR) = 1.69 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.15-2.48). The controlled
  direct effect (the association through all potential pathways except that of unemployment)
  was: RR = 1.65 (95% CI = 1.08-2.53). We found evidence of an overall association
  between IDU and severe FI and estimated a controlled direct effect that is suggestive
  of pathways from IDU to severe FI that are not mediated by unemployment. Specifically,
  an overall association and a controlled direct effect that are similar in magnitude
  suggests that the potential impact of IDU on unemployment is not the primary mechanism
  through which IDU is associated with severe FI. Therefore, while further research
  is required to understand the mechanisms linking IDU and severe FI, the strong overall
  association suggests that reductions in IDU may mitigate severe FI in this vulnerable
  subset of the HIV-positive population.'
