abstract: "OBJECTIVE: To examine the frequency of reporting of absolute and relative\
  \ effect measures in health inequalities research. DESIGN: Structured review of\
  \ selected general medical and public health journals. DATA SOURCES: 344 articles\
  \ published during 2009 in American Journal of Epidemiology, American Journal of\
  \ Public Health, BMJ, Epidemiology, International Journal of Epidemiology, JAMA,\
  \ Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health, The Lancet, The New England Journal\
  \ of Medicine, and Social Science and Medicine. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Frequency\
  \ and proportion of studies reporting absolute effect measures, relative effect\
  \ measures, or both in abstract and full text; availability of absolute risks in\
  \ studies reporting only relative effect measures. RESULTS: 40% (138/344) of articles\
  \ reported a measure of effect in the abstract; among these, 88% (122/138) reported\
  \ only a relative measure, 9% (13/138) reported only an absolute measure, and 2%\
  \ (3/138) reported both. 75% (258/344) of all articles reported only relative measures\
  \ in the full text; among these, 46% (119/258) contained no information on absolute\
  \ baseline risks that would facilitate calculation of absolute effect measures.\
  \ 18% (61/344) of all articles reported only absolute measures in the full text,\
  \ and 7% (25/344) reported both absolute and relative measures. These results were\
  \ consistent across journals, exposures, and outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Health inequalities\
  \ are most commonly reported using only relative measures of effect, which may influence\
  \ readers' judgments of the magnitude, direction, significance, and implications\
  \ of reported health inequalities."
