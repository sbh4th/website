abstract: "Investigations of age, period, and cohort effects are difficult because\
  \ the 3 factors are linearly dependent. In a novel application, Kramer et al. (Am\
  \ J Epidemiol. 2015;182(4):302-312) have used graphical analysis and statistical\
  \ models to estimate the impact that age, period, and cohort effects have had on\
  \ trends in black-white inequalities in heart disease mortality. Using a constrained\
  \ regression approach (with the first 2 periods' effects constrained to zero), Kramer\
  \ et al. find evidence that age and cohort effects figure more prominently than\
  \ do period effects in contributing to relative black-white mortality differences,\
  \ and they argue that early-life exposures should be given greater consideration\
  \ for mitigation of racial differences in heart disease. In this invited commentary,\
  \ I argue that the utility of age-period-cohort models for understanding health\
  \ inequalities depends on the plausibility of the assumptions used to break the\
  \ link between the 3 factors. Based on the existing age-period-cohort literature,\
  \ alternative assumptions seem likely to produce substantially different results.\
  \ I also argue that interpretations of the impacts of age, period, and cohort effects\
  \ on racial inequalities in heart disease mortality may depend on whether inequalities\
  \ are assessed on the absolute scale or the relative scale. "
