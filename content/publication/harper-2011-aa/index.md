abstract: This article reviews the historical declines in cardiovascular mortality
  and provides an overview of the contribution of social and economic factors to disease
  change. We document the magnitude of declines in cardiovascular diseases and the
  major role of changes in conventional risk factors, and we review the contributions
  of social determinants to changes in disease rates. We conclude by arguing that
  understanding patterns and trends of social inequalities in cardiovascular disease
  and its risk factors requires consideration of the specific intersections of health
  and social exposures acting across the life course in different settings, in both
  time and place.
