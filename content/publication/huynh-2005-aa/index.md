abstract: "BACKGROUND: Though associations between income inequality and birth outcome\
  \ have been suggested, mechanisms underlying this relationship are not known. In\
  \ this analysis, we examined the relationship between income inequality and preterm\
  \ birth (PTB) and post-neonatal mortality (PNM) to explore two potential mechanisms-the\
  \ proposed psychosocial stress and neo-material pathways. METHODS: Data on singleton\
  \ births from 1998 to 2000 were obtained from the CDC's National Center for Health\
  \ Statistics' Linked Birth and Infant Death files. The Gini Index was utilized to\
  \ measure income inequality and was divided into tertiles representing high, medium,\
  \ and low county-level inequality. To determine the association between the birth\
  \ outcomes and county income inequality and to account for clustering within counties,\
  \ we employed generalized estimating equation (GEE) modelling. RESULTS: PTB increased\
  \ from 8.3% in counties with low income inequality to 10.0% in counties with high\
  \ inequality. The Gini Index remained modestly associated with PTB after adjusting\
  \ for individual level variables and mean county-level per capita income within\
  \ the total population (AOR: 1.06; 95% CI 1.03-1.09) as well as within most of the\
  \ racial/ethnic groups. PNM increased from 1.15 deaths per 1000 live births in low\
  \ inequality counties to 1.32 in high-inequality counties. However, after adjustment,\
  \ income inequality was only associated with PNM within the non-Hispanic black population\
  \ (AOR: 1.20; 95% CI 1.03-1.39). CONCLUSIONS: These findings may provide some support\
  \ for the association between income inequality and PTB. Further research is required\
  \ to elucidate the biological mechanisms of income inequality."
