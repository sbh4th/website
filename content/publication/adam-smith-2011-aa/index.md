abstract: 'OBJECTIVES: Inequalities in life expectancy between the most and least
  materially deprived areas in the province of Quebec, Canada are increasing, but
  the reasons for this trend are unclear. An analysis of which causes of death, in
  which age groups, are implicated in this trend is necessary to understand it and
  provide clear targets for intervention. METHODS: We analyzed Quebec mortality data
  for three 4-year periods from 1989-2004. Differences in life expectancy at birth
  between the most- and least-deprived areas in each period and over time were decomposed
  by age and cause of death for men and women using the Arriaga method. RESULTS: Life
  expectancy increased for all areas, but the increase was smaller in deprived areas.
  Cancer, heart disease and unintentional injuries accounted for the largest shares
  of inequality in each period. Among women, the widening life expectancy gap was
  largely due to increased lung cancer mortality. Among men, mortality from HIV was
  an important cause of widening inequality. Increasing inequality in both sexes was
  offset by a decrease in mortality from unintentional injuries in deprived areas
  (narrowing the gap between the most- and least-deprived areas). The largest share
  of inequality among women was due to deaths in the 65-and-over age group. Among
  men, the largest share shifted over time from middle-age to the 65-and-over age
  group. CONCLUSION: The widening life expectancy gap between advantaged and disadvantaged
  areas in Quebec is driven by relatively few causes of death with well-known risk
  factors and strategies for prevention.'
