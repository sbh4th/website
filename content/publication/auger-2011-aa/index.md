abstract: 'PURPOSE: To evaluate relative and absolute relationships between preterm
  birth (PTB) and neighborhood education over time. METHODS: Live births in Qu√©bec,
  Canada, were obtained for 1990-1995, 1996-2000, and 2001-2006. Mean maternal education
  and proportion of females with no high school diploma were expressed as continuous
  cumulative rank scores for 10,923 neighborhoods. We estimated the relative hazard
  of PTB (<37 gestational weeks) for neighborhood education in each period by using
  Cox proportional hazards regression, accounting for individual education, age, marital
  status, birthplace, language, parity, infant sex, rurality, neighborhood income,
  and area clustering. Adjusted absolute differences in the prevalence of PTB between
  the most and least educated neighborhoods were calculated. RESULTS: PTB prevalence
  (6.1% overall) was greater in less-educated neighborhoods. Although PTB proportions
  increased over time in all neighborhoods, the increase was proportionately greater
  for less-educated areas. Hazards of PTB for neighborhood education were proportional
  over gestation. Depending on the indicator of neighborhood education and period,
  adjusted hazards of PTB were 10%-37% greater for the least relative to most educated
  neighborhoods, and prevalence percentage differences ranged from 0.6% to 1.9%. Associations
  persisted over time. CONCLUSIONS: Relative and absolute neighborhood educational
  inequalities in PTB, independent of individual education, were present and persistent
  over time.'
