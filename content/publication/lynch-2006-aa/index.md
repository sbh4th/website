abstract: 'STUDY OBJECTIVES: There are contradictory perspectives on the importance
  of conventional coronary heart disease (CHD) risk factors in explaining population
  levels and social gradients in CHD. This study examined the contribution of conventional
  CHD risk factors (smoking, hypertension, dyslipidaemia, and diabetes) to explaining
  population levels and to absolute and relative social inequalities in CHD. This
  was investigated in an entire population and by creating a low risk sub-population
  with no smoking, dyslipidaemia, diabetes, and hypertension to simulate what would
  happen to relative and social inequalities in CHD if conventional risk factors were
  removed. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Population based study of 2682 eastern
  Finnish men aged 42, 48, 54, 60 at baseline with 10.5 years average follow up of
  fatal (ICD9 codes 410-414) and non-fatal (MONICA criteria) CHD events. MAIN RESULTS:
  In the whole population, 94.6% of events occurred among men exposed to at least
  one conventional risk factor, with a PAR of 68%. Adjustment for conventional risk
  factors reduced relative social inequality by 24%. However, in a low risk population
  free from conventional risk factors, absolute social inequality reduced by 72%.
  CONCLUSIONS: Conventional risk factors explain the majority of absolute social inequality
  in CHD because conventional risk factors explain the vast majority of CHD cases
  in the population. However, the role of conventional risk factors in explaining
  relative social inequality was modest. This apparent paradox may arise in populations
  where inequalities in conventional risk factors between social groups are low, relative
  to the high levels of conventional risk factors within every social group. If the
  concern is to reduce the overall population health burden of CHD and the disproportionate
  population health burden associated with the social inequalities in CHD, then reducing
  conventional risk factors will do the job.'
