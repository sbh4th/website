abstract: This article reviews 98 aggregate and multilevel studies examining the associations
  between income inequality and health. Overall, there seems to be little support
  for the idea that income inequality is a major, generalizable determinant of population
  health differences within or between rich countries. Income inequality may, however,
  directly influence some health outcomes, such as homicide in some contexts. The
  strongest evidence for direct health effects is among states in the United States,
  but even that is somewhat mixed. Despite little support for a direct effect of income
  inequality on health per se, reducing income inequality by raising the incomes of
  the most disadvantaged will improve their health, help reduce health inequalities,
  and generally improve population health.
