abstract: The Kimberley region in Western Australia hosts one of the world's most
  substantial bodies of indigenous rock art thought to extend in a series of stylistic
  or iconographic phases from the present day back into the Pleistocene. As with other
  rock art worldwide, the older styles have proven notoriously difficult to date quantitatively,
  requiring new scientific approaches. Here, we present the radiocarbon ages of 24
  mud wasp nests that were either over or under pigment from 21 anthropomorphic motifs
  of the Gwion style (previously referred to as \"Bradshaws\") from the middle of
  the relative stylistic sequence. We demonstrate that while one date suggests a minimum
  age of c. 17 ka for one motif, most of the dates support a hypothesis that these
  Gwion paintings were produced in a relatively narrow period around 12,000 years
  ago.
