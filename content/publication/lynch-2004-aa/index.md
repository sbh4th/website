abstract: This article describes U.S. income inequality and 100-year national and
  30-year regional trends in age- and cause-specific mortality. There is little congruence
  between national trends in income inequality and age- or cause-specific mortality
  except perhaps for suicide and homicide. The variable trends in some causes of mortality
  may be associated regionally with income inequality. However, between 1978 and 2000
  those regions experiencing the largest increases in income inequality had the largest
  declines in mortality (r= 0.81, p < 0.001). Understanding the social determinants
  of population health requires appreciating how broad indicators of social and economic
  conditions are related, at different times and places, to the levels and social
  distribution of major risk factors for particular health outcomes.
