abstract: 'INTRODUCTION: There is evidence that greater neighbourhood walkability
  (i.e., neighbourhoods with more amenities and well-connected streets) is associated
  with higher levels of total walking in Europe and in Asia, but it remains unclear
  if this association holds in the Canadian context and in chronic disease populations.
  We examined the relationships of different walkability measures to biosensor-assessed
  total walking (i.e., steps/day) in adults with type 2 diabetes living in Montreal
  (QC, Canada). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Participants (60.5$±$10.4 years; 48.1% women)
  were recruited through McGill University-affiliated clinics (June 2006 to May 2008).
  Steps/day were assessed once per season for one year with pedometers. Neighbourhood
  walkability was evaluated through participant reports, in-field audits, Geographic
  Information Systems (GIS)-derived measures, and the Walk Score®. Relationships between
  walkability and daily steps were estimated using Bayesian longitudinal hierarchical
  linear regression models (n = 131). RESULTS: Participants who reported living in
  the most compared to the least walkable neighbourhoods completed 1345 more steps/day
  (95% Credible Interval: 718, 1976; Quartiles 4 versus 1). Those living in the most
  compared to the least walkable neighbourhoods (based on GIS-derived walkability)
  completed 606 more steps per day (95% CrI: 8, 1203). No statistically significant
  associations with steps were observed for audit-assessed walkability or the Walk
  Score®. CONCLUSIONS: Adults with type 2 diabetes who perceived their neighbourhoods
  as more walkable accumulated more daily steps. This suggests that knowledge of local
  neighborhood features that enhance walking is a meaningful predictor of higher levels
  of walking and an important component of neighbourhood walkability.'
