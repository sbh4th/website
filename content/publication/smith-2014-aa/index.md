abstract: "Reducing health inequalities has become a major public health priority\
  \ internationally. However, how best to achieve this goal is not well understood.\
  \ Population health intervention research has the potential to address some of this\
  \ knowledge gap. This review argues that simulation studies can produce unique evidence\
  \ to build the population health intervention research evidence base on reducing\
  \ social inequalities in health. To this effect, the advantages of using simulation\
  \ models over other population health intervention research methods are discussed.\
  \ Key questions regarding the potential challenges of developing simulation models\
  \ to investigate population health intervention research on reducing social inequalities\
  \ in health and the types of population health intervention research questions that\
  \ can be answered using this methodology are reviewed. We use the example of social\
  \ inequalities in coronary heart disease to illustrate how simulation models can\
  \ elucidate the effectiveness of a number of 'what-if' counterfactual population\
  \ health interventions on reducing social inequalities in coronary heart disease.\
  \ Simulation models are a flexible, cost-effective, evidence-based research method\
  \ with the capacity to inform public health policy-makers regarding the implementation\
  \ of population health interventions to reduce social inequalities in health. "
