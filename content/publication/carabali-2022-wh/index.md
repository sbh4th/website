abstract: 'BACKGROUND: We used surveillance data from Brazil and Colombia during 2007-2017
  to assess the presence of socioeconomic inequalities on dengue, chikungunya and
  Zika at the neighborhood level in two Latin American cities. METHODS: To quantify
  the inequality, we estimated and decomposed the relative concentration index of
  inequality (RCI) accounting for the spatiotemporal distribution of the diseases.
  RESULTS: There were 281 426 arboviral cases notified in Fortaleza, Brazil, and 40
  889 in Medellin, Colombia. The RCI indicated greater concentration of dengue cases
  among people living in low socioeconomic settings in both sites. The RCIs for chikungunya
  in Fortaleza covered the line of equality during their introduction in 2014, while
  the RCIs for Zika and chikungunya in Medellin indicated the presence of a small
  inequality. The RCI decomposition showed that year of notification and age were
  the main contributors to this inequality. In Medellin, the RCI decomposition showed
  that age and access to waste management accounted for 75.5%, 72.2% and 54.5% of
  the overall inequality towards the poor for dengue, chikungunya and Zika, respectively.
  CONCLUSIONS: Our study presents estimates of the socioeconomic inequality of arboviruses
  and its decomposition in two Latin American cities. We corroborate the concentration
  of arboviral diseases in low socioeconomic neighborhoods and identify that year
  of occurrence, age, presence of healthcare facilities and waste management are key
  determinants of the heterogenous distribution of endemic arboviruses across the
  socioeconomic spectrum.'
