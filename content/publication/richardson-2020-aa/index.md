abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Extremes in water availability, either exceptionally wet or
  dry conditions, can damage crops and may detrimentally affect the livelihood and
  well-being of people engaged in agriculture. We estimated the effect of water availability
  on suicide in rural India, a context where the majority of households are dependent
  upon agriculture. METHODS: We used data from a nationally representative sample
  of 8.5 million people who were monitored for causes of death from 2001 to 2013.
  Water availability was measured with high-resolution precipitation and temperature
  data (i.e., the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index). We used a
  fixed effects approach that modeled changes in water availability within districts
  (n = 569) over time (n = 13 years) to estimate the impact on suicide deaths. We
  restricted our analysis to rural areas and to deaths occurring during the growing
  season (June-March) among adults aged 15 or older, and controlled for sex, age,
  region, and year. We used Poisson regression with standard errors clustered at the
  district level and total deaths as the offset. RESULTS: There were 9456 suicides
  and 249,786 total deaths in our study population between 2001 and 2013. Compared
  to normal growing seasons, the percent of deaths due to suicide increased by 18.7%
  during extremely wet growing seasons (95% CI: 6.2, 31.2) and by 3.6% during extremely
  dry growing seasons (95% CI: -17.9, 25.0). We found that effects varied by age.
  CONCLUSIONS: We found extremes is water availability associated with an increase
  in suicide. Abnormally wet growing conditions may play an important, yet overlooked,
  role in suicide among rural Indian adults.'
