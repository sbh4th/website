abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Monitoring inequalities in non communicable disease risk factor
  prevalence can help to inform and target effective interventions. The prevalence
  of current daily smoking, low fruit and vegetable consumption, physical inactivity,
  and heavy episodic alcohol drinking were quantified and compared across wealth and
  education levels in low- and middle-income country groups. METHODS: This study included
  self-reported data from 232,056 adult participants in 48 countries, derived from
  the 2002-2004 World Health Survey. Data were stratified by sex and low- or middle-income
  country status. The main outcome measurements were risk factor prevalence rates
  reported by wealth quintile and five levels of educational attainment. Socioeconomic
  inequalities were measured using the slope index of inequality, reflecting differences
  in prevalence rates, and the relative index of inequality, reflecting the prevalence
  ratio between the two extremes of wealth or education accounting for the entire
  distribution. Data were adjusted for confounding factors: sex, age, marital status,
  area of residence, and country of residence. RESULTS: Smoking and low fruit and
  vegetable consumption were significantly higher among lower socioeconomic groups.
  The highest wealth-related absolute inequality was seen in smoking among men of
  low- income country group (slope index of inequality 23.0 percentage points; 95%
  confidence interval 19.6, 26.4). The slope index of inequality for low fruit and
  vegetable consumption across the entire distribution of education was around 8 percentage
  points in both sexes and both country income groups. Physical inactivity was less
  prevalent in populations of low socioeconomic status, especially in low-income countries
  (relative index of inequality: (men) 0.46, 95% confidence interval 0.33, 0.64; (women)
  0.52, 95% confidence interval 0.42, 0.65). Mixed patterns were found for heavy drinking.
  CONCLUSIONS: Disaggregated analysis of the prevalence of non-communicable disease
  risk factors demonstrated different patterns and varying degrees of socioeconomic
  inequalities across low- and middle-income settings. Interventions should aim to
  reach and achieve sustained benefits for high-risk populations.'
