abstract: 'Coverage of skilled delivery care has been increasing across most low-income
  countries; however, it remains far from universal and is very unequally distributed
  according to socioeconomic position. In an effort to increase coverage of skilled
  delivery care and reduce socioeconomic inequalities, governments of several countries
  in sub-Saharan Africa have recently adopted policies that remove user fees for facility-based
  delivery services. There is little rigorous evidence of the impact of these policies
  and few studies have examined effects on socioeconomic inequalities. This study
  investigates the impact of recent delivery fee exemption policies in Ghana, Senegal,
  and Sierra Leone on socioeconomic differences in the use of facility-based delivery
  services. Using Demographic and Health Survey data from nine sub-Saharan African
  countries, we evaluated the user fee policy changes using a difference-in-differences
  approach that accounts for underlying common secular trends and time invariant differences
  among countries, and allows for differential effects of the policy by socioeconomic
  position. Removing user fees was consistent with meaningful increases in facility
  deliveries across all categories of household wealth and maternal education. We
  found little evidence of differential effects of removing user fees across quartiles
  of household wealth, with increases of 5.4 facility deliveries per hundred live
  births (95% CI: 2.1, 8.8) among women in the poorest quartile and 6.8 per hundred
  live births (95% CI: 4.0, 9.7) for women in the richest quartile. However, our results
  suggest that educated women benefited more from removing user fees compared to women
  with no education. For women with at least some secondary education, the estimated
  effect was 8.6 facility deliveries per hundred live births (95% CI: 5.4, 11.9),
  but only 4.6 per hundred live births (95% CI: 2.2, 7.0) for women with no education
  (heterogeneity p-value = 0.04). Thus, while removing fees at the point of service
  increased facility deliveries across the socioeconomic gradient, it did not reduce
  inequalities defined by household wealth and may have contributed to a widening
  of educational inequalities. These findings emphasize the need for concerted efforts
  to address financial and other barriers that contribute to large and persistent
  socioeconomic inequalities in delivery care. '
