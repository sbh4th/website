abstract: Injection drug use (IDU) and food insecurity (FI) are highly prevalent among
  individuals living with HIV-hepatitis C virus (HCV) co-infection. We quantified
  the association between IDU and FI among co-infected individuals using biannual
  data from the Canadian Co-infection Cohort (N = 608, 2012-2015). IDU (in the past
  six months) and IDU frequency (non-weekly/weekly in the past month) were self-reported.
  FI (in the past six months) and FI severity (marginal FI, moderate FI, and severe
  FI) were measured using the Household Food Security Survey Module. Generalized estimating
  equations were used to estimate risk ratios (RR) quantifying the associations between
  IDU, IDU frequency, and FI with Poisson regression. The associations between IDU,
  IDU frequency, and FI severity were quantified by relative-risk ratios (RRR) estimated
  with multinomial regression. At the first time-point in the analytical sample, 54%
  of participants experienced FI in the past six months, 31% engaged in IDU in the
  six months preceding the FI measure, and 24% injected drugs in the past month. After
  adjustment for confounding, IDU in the past six months (RR = 1.15, 95% confidence
  interval [CI] = 1.04-1.28) as well as non-weekly (RR = 1.15, 95% CI = 1.02-1.29)
  and weekly IDU (RR = 1.21, 95% CI = 1.07-1.37) in the past month are associated
  with FI. Weekly IDU in the past month is also strongly associated with severe FI
  (RRR = 2.68, 95% CI = 1.47-4.91). Our findings indicate that there is an association
  between IDU and FI, particularly weekly IDU and severe FI. This suggests that reductions
  in IDU may mitigate FI, especially severe FI, in this vulnerable subset of the HIV-positive
  population.
