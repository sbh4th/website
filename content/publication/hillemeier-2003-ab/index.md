abstract: "OBJECTIVES: The purpose of the present study was to compare the associations\
  \ of state-referenced and federal poverty measures with states' infant and child\
  \ mortality rates. METHODS: Compressed mortality and Current Population Survey data\
  \ were used to examine relationships between mortality and (1) state-referenced\
  \ poverty (percentage of children below half the state median income) and (2) percentage\
  \ of children below the federal poverty line. RESULTS: State-referenced poverty\
  \ was not associated with mortality among infants or children, whereas poverty as\
  \ defined by national standards was strongly related to mortality. CONCLUSIONS:\
  \ Infant and child mortality is more closely tied to families' capacity for meeting\
  \ basic needs than to relative position within a state's economic hierarchy."
