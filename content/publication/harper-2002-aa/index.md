abstract: "BACKGROUND: Various psychosocial factors have been linked to adult physical\
  \ health and are also associated with socioeconomic position in adulthood. We evaluated\
  \ the effect of socioeconomic conditions over the life course on measures of psychosocial\
  \ functioning in adulthood. METHODS: Life course socioeconomic position was assessed\
  \ by retrospective recall of parents' education and occupation when the respondent\
  \ was age 10, and the respondents' education, occupation, and income in 2585 men\
  \ from eastern Finland aged 42, 48, 54, and 60 years. Measures of psychosocial functioning\
  \ were derived from scales measuring cynical hostility, hopelessness, and depressive\
  \ symptoms. RESULTS: Men with both parents who had less than a primary school education\
  \ or who both had unskilled manual jobs had higher age-adjusted levels of cynical\
  \ hostility, hopelessness, and depressive symptoms in adulthood. Mutually adjusted\
  \ analyses showed that parents' education and the respondents' education, occupation,\
  \ and income all had statistically independent effects on adult levels of cynical\
  \ hostility and hopelessness. For instance, men for whom neither parent had completed\
  \ primary education had a 0.15 standard deviation (P = 0.006) higher cynical hostility\
  \ score, and a 0.20 standard deviation (P = 0.00018) higher hopelessness score,\
  \ after adjustment for education, occupation and income. In contrast, depressive\
  \ symptoms in adulthood were only associated with the respondent's occupation and\
  \ income. CONCLUSIONS: Childhood socioeconomic position was associated with adult\
  \ psychosocial functioning, but these effects were specific to some aspects of adult\
  \ psychosocial functioning--cynical hostility and hopelessness, but not depressive\
  \ symptoms. Adult occupation and income were associated with all measures of psychosocial\
  \ functioning. In addition to the impact of adult socioeconomic position, some aspects\
  \ of poor psychosocial functioning in adulthood may also have socioeconomic roots\
  \ early in life."
