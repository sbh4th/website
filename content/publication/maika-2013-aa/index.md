abstract: "BACKGROUND: Measuring social inequalities in health is common; however,\
  \ research examining inequalities in child cognitive function is more limited. We\
  \ investigated household expenditure-related inequality in children's cognitive\
  \ function in Indonesia in 2000 and 2007, the contributors to inequality in both\
  \ time periods, and changes in the contributors to cognitive function inequalities\
  \ between the periods. METHODS: Data from the 2000 and 2007 round of the Indonesian\
  \ Family Life Survey (IFLS) were used. Study participants were children aged 7-14\
  \ years (n = 6179 and n = 6680 in 2000 and 2007, respectively). The relative concentration\
  \ index (RCI) was used to measure the magnitude of inequality. Contribution of various\
  \ contributors to inequality was estimated by decomposing the concentration index\
  \ in 2000 and 2007. Oaxaca-type decomposition was used to estimate changes in contributors\
  \ to inequality between 2000 and 2007. RESULTS: Expenditure inequality decreased\
  \ by 45% from an RCI = 0.29 (95% CI 0.22 to 0.36) in 2000 to 0.16 (95% CI 0.13 to\
  \ 0.20) in 2007 but the burden of poorer cognitive function was higher among the\
  \ disadvantaged in both years. The largest contributors to inequality in child cognitive\
  \ function were inequalities in per capita expenditure, use of improved sanitation\
  \ and maternal high school attendance. Changes in maternal high school participation\
  \ (27%), use of improved sanitation (25%) and per capita expenditures (18%) were\
  \ largely responsible for the decreasing inequality in children's cognitive function\
  \ between 2000 and 2007. CONCLUSIONS: Government policy to increase basic education\
  \ coverage for women along with economic growth may have influenced gains in children's\
  \ cognitive function and reductions in inequalities in Indonesia."
