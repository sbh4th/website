abstract: "Background: The extent to which differences in homicide and suicide rates\
  \ in black versus white men vary by U.S. state is unknown. Objective: To compare\
  \ the rates of firearm and nonfirearm homicide and suicide in black and white non-Hispanic\
  \ men by U.S. state and to examine whether these deaths are associated with state\
  \ prevalence of gun ownership. Design: Surveillance study. Setting: 50 states and\
  \ the District of Columbia, 2008 to 2016. Cause-of-death data were abstracted by\
  \ using the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's WONDER (Wide-ranging Online\
  \ Data for Epidemiologic Research) database. Participants: Non-Hispanic black and\
  \ non-Hispanic white males, all ages. Measurements: Absolute rates of and rate differences\
  \ in firearm and nonfirearm homicide and suicide in black and white men. Results:\
  \ During the 9-year study period, 84 113 homicides and 251 772 suicides occurred.\
  \ Black-white differences in rates of firearm homicide and suicide varied widely\
  \ across states. Relative to white men, black men had between 9 and 57 additional\
  \ firearm homicides per 100 000 per year, with black men in Missouri, Michigan,\
  \ Illinois, Indiana, and Pennsylvania having more than 40 additional firearm homicides\
  \ per 100 000 per year. White men had between 2 fewer and 16 more firearm suicides\
  \ per 100 000 per year, with the largest inequalities observed in southern and western\
  \ states and the smallest in the District of Columbia and densely populated northeastern\
  \ states. Limitations: Some homicides and suicides may have been misclassified as\
  \ deaths due to unintentional injury. Survey data on state household gun ownership\
  \ were collected in 2004 and may have shifted during the past decade. Conclusion:\
  \ The large state-to-state variation in firearm homicide and suicide rates, as well\
  \ as the racial inequalities in these numbers, highlights states where policies\
  \ may be most beneficial in reducing homicide and suicide deaths and the racial\
  \ disparities in their rates. Primary Funding Source: McGill University and the\
  \ National Institutes of Health."
