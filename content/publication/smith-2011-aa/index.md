abstract: "Evidence is lacking on whether the duration and timing of low socioeconomic\
  \ position (SEP) across a person's life course may be associated with incidence\
  \ of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D). The authors' objectives were to investigate\
  \ associations between cumulative SEP and the incidence of T2D in the Framingham\
  \ Offspring Study (n = 1,893; 52% women; mean baseline age = 34 years). Pooled logistic\
  \ regression analyses demonstrated that age-adjusted cumulative SEP was associated\
  \ with T2D in women (for low vs. high cumulative SEP, odds ratio (OR) = 1.92, 95%\
  \ confidence interval (CI): 1.08, 3.42). Age-adjusted analyses for young-adulthood\
  \ SEP (7.85 for â‰¤12 vs. >16 years of education, OR = 2.84, 95% CI: 1.03), active\
  \ professional life SEP (for laborer vs. professional/executive/supervisory/technical\
  \ occupations, OR = 2.40, 95% CI: 1.05, 5.47), and social-mobility frameworks (for\
  \ declining life-course SEP, OR = 2.99, 95% CI: 1.39, 6.44; for stable low vs. stable\
  \ high life-course SEP, OR = 1.85, 95% CI: 1.02, 3.35) all demonstrated associations\
  \ between low SEP and T2D incidence in women. No association was observed between\
  \ childhood SEP and T2D in women for father's education (some high school or less\
  \ vs. any postsecondary education, OR = 1.26, 95% CI: 0.72, 2.22). In men, there\
  \ was little evidence of associations between life-course SEP and T2D incidence.\
  \ These findings suggest that cumulative SEP is inversely associated with incidence\
  \ of T2D in women, and that this association may be primarily due to the women's\
  \ educational levels and occupations."
