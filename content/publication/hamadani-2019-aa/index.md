abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Mozambique has had no policy-driven trauma system and no hospital-based
  trauma registries, and injury was not a public health priority. In other low-income
  countries, trauma system implementation and trauma registries have helped to reduce
  mortality from injury by up to 35%. In 2014, we introduced a trauma registry in
  four hospitals in Maputo serving 18,000 patients yearly. The project has since expanded
  nationally. This study summarizes the challenges, results, and lessons learned from
  this large national undertaking. METHODS: Between October 2014-September 2015, we
  implemented a trauma registry at four hospitals in Maputo. In October 2015, the
  project began to be expanded nationally. Physicians and allied health professionals
  at each hospital were trained to implement the registry, and each identified and
  trained data collectors. We conducted semi-structured interviews with the key stakeholders
  of this project to identify the challenges, results, and creative solutions implemented
  for the success of this project. RESULTS: Most participants identified the importance
  of having a trauma registry and its usefulness in identifying gaps in trauma care.
  The registry identified that less than 5% of injured patients arrived by ambulance,
  which served as evidence for the need for a prehospital system, which the Ministry
  of Health had already begun implementing. Participants also highlighted how the
  registry has allowed for a structured clinical approach to patients, ensuring that
  severely injured patients are identified early. Challenges reported included the
  high rates of missing data, the difficulty in establishing a streamlined flow of
  trauma patients within each hospital, and the bureaucratic challenges faced when
  attempting to improve capacity for trauma care at each hospital by introducing a
  trauma bay and new technologies. Participants identified the need to improve data
  completeness, to disseminate the results of the project nationally and internationally,
  to improve inter-divisional cooperation, and to continue educating health providers
  on the importance of registries. Participants also identified political instabilities
  in the region as a potential source of challenge in expanding the project nationally;
  they also identified the lack of uniform resource allocation and low personnel in
  many areas, especially rural, as a major burden that would need to be overcome.
  CONCLUSION: Introduction of a trauma registry system in Mozambique is feasible and
  necessary. Initial findings provide insight into the nature of traumas seen in Maputo
  hospitals, but also underscore future challenges, especially in minimizing missing
  data, utilizing data to develop evidence-based trauma prevention policies, and ensuring
  the sustainability of these efforts by ensuring continued governmental support,
  education, and resource allocation. Many of these measures are being undertaken.'
