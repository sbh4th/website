abstract: "INTRODUCTION: Recent increases in maternal mortality and persistent disparities\
  \ have led to speculation about why the U.S. has higher rates than most high-income\
  \ countries. The aim was to examine the impact of changes in state-level factors\
  \ plausibly linked to maternal mortality on overall rates and by race/ethnicity.\
  \ METHODS: This quasi-experimental, population-based, difference-in-differences\
  \ study used 2007-2015 National Vital Statistics System microdata mortality files\
  \ from 38 states and DC. The primary exposures were 5 state-level sexual and reproductive\
  \ health indicators and 6 health and economic conditions. Maternal mortality rate\
  \ was defined as number of deaths of women while pregnant or within 42 days of termination\
  \ of pregnancy per 100,000 live births. A difference-in-differences zero-inflated\
  \ negative binomial regression model was estimated using the race/ethnicity-age-state-year\
  \ population as the denominator and adjusting for race/ethnicity, age, state, and\
  \ year. Data were analyzed in 2017-2018. RESULTS: There were 4,767 deaths among\
  \ women up to age 44 years, resulting in a maternal mortality rate of 17.9. Reducing\
  \ the proportion of Planned Parenthood clinics by 20% from the state-year mean increased\
  \ the maternal mortality rate by 8% (incidence rate ratio, 1.08; 95% CI=1.04, 1.12).\
  \ States that enacted legislation to restrict abortions based on gestational age\
  \ increased the maternal mortality rate by 38% (incidence rate ratio, 1.38; 95%\
  \ CI=1.03, 1.84). Planned Parenthood clinic closures negatively impacted all women,\
  \ increasing mortality by 6%-15% across racial/ethnic groups, whereas gestational\
  \ limits primarily increased mortality among white women. CONCLUSIONS: Recent fiscal\
  \ and legislative changes reducing women's access to family planning and reproductive\
  \ health services have contributed to rising maternal mortality rates."
