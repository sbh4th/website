abstract: Observational studies are ambiguous, difficult, and necessary for epidemiology.
  Presently, there are concerns that the evidence produced by most observational studies
  in epidemiology is not credible and contributes to research waste. I argue that
  observational epidemiology could be improved by focusing greater attention on 1)
  defining questions that make clear whether the inferential goal is descriptive or
  causal; 2) greater utilization of quantitative bias analysis and alternative research
  designs that aim to decrease the strength of assumptions needed to estimate causal
  effects; and 3) promoting, experimenting with, and perhaps institutionalizing both
  reproducible research standards and replication studies to evaluate the fragility
  of study findings in epidemiology. Greater clarity, credibility, and transparency
  in observational epidemiology will help to provide reliable evidence that can serve
  as a basis for making decisions about clinical or population-health interventions.
