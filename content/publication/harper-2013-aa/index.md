abstract: 'Formally evaluating how specific policy measures influence environmental
  justice is challenging, especially in the context of regulatory analyses in which
  quantitative comparisons are the norm. However, there is a large literature on developing
  and applying quantitative measures of health inequality in other settings, and these
  measures may be applicable to environmental regulatory analyses. In this paper,
  we provide information to assist policy decision makers in determining the viability
  of using measures of health inequality in the context of environmental regulatory
  analyses. We conclude that quantification of the distribution of inequalities in
  health outcomes across social groups of concern, considering both within-group and
  between-group comparisons, would be consistent with both the structure of regulatory
  analysis and the core definition of environmental justice. Appropriate application
  of inequality indicators requires thorough characterization of the baseline distribution
  of exposures and risks, leveraging data generally available within regulatory analyses.
  Multiple inequality indicators may be applicable to regulatory analyses, and the
  choice among indicators should be based on explicit value judgments regarding the
  dimensions of environmental justice of greatest interest. '
