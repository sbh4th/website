abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Commissioned by the International Epidemiological Association,
  this article is part of a series on burden of disease, health indicators and the
  challenges faced by epidemiologists in bringing their discoveries to provide equitable
  benefit to the populations in their regions and globally. This report covers the
  health status and epidemiological capacity in the North American region (USA and
  Canada). METHODS: We assessed data from country-specific sources to identify health
  priorities and areas of greatest need for modifiable risk factors. We examined inequalities
  in health as a function of social deprivation. We also reviewed information on epidemiological
  capacity building and scientific contributions by epidemiologists in the region.
  FINDINGS: The USA and Canada enjoy technologically advanced healthcare systems that,
  in principle, prioritize preventive services. Both countries experience a life expectancy
  at birth that is higher than the global mean. Health indicator measures are consistently
  worse in the USA than in Canada for many outcomes, although typically by only marginal
  amounts. Socio-economic and racial/ethnic disparities in indicators exist for many
  diseases and risk factors in the USA. To a lesser extent, these social inequalities
  also exist in Canada, particularly among the Aboriginal populations. Epidemiology
  is a well-established discipline in the region, with many degree-granting schools,
  societies and job opportunities in the public and private sectors. North American
  epidemiologists have made important contributions in disease control and prevention
  and provide nearly a third of the global scientific output via published papers.
  CONCLUSIONS: Critical challenges for North American epidemiologists include social
  determinants of disease distribution and the underlying inequalities in access to
  and benefit from preventive services and healthcare, particularly in the USA. The
  gains in life expectancy also underscore the need for research on health promotion
  and prevention of disease and disability in older adults. The diversity in epidemiological
  subspecialties poses new challenges in training and accreditation and has occurred
  in parallel with a decrease in research funding.'
