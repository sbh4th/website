abstract: 'OBJECTIVES: Mortality rates generally decline during economic recessions
  in high-income countries, however gaps remain in our understanding of the underlying
  mechanisms. This study estimates the impacts of increases in unemployment rates
  on both all-cause and cause-specific mortality across U.S. metropolitan regions
  during the Great Recession. METHODS: We estimate the effects of economic conditions
  during the recent and severe recessionary period on mortality, including differences
  by age and gender subgroups, using fixed effects regression models. We identify
  a plausibly causal effect by isolating the impacts of within-metropolitan area changes
  in unemployment rates and controlling for common temporal trends. We aggregated
  vital statistics, population, and unemployment data at the area-month-year-age-gender-race
  level, yielding 527,040 observations across 366 metropolitan areas, 2005-2010. RESULTS:
  We estimate that a one percentage point increase in the metropolitan area unemployment
  rate was associated with a decrease in all-cause mortality of 3.95 deaths per 100,000
  person years (95%CI -6.80 to -1.10), or 0.5%. Estimated reductions in cardiovascular
  disease mortality contributed 60% of the overall effect and were more pronounced
  among women. Motor vehicle accident mortality declined with unemployment increases,
  especially for men and those under age 65, as did legal intervention and homicide
  mortality, particularly for men and adults ages 25-64. We find suggestive evidence
  that increases in metropolitan area unemployment increased accidental drug poisoning
  deaths for both men and women ages 25-64. CONCLUSIONS: Our finding that all-cause
  mortality decreased during the Great Recession is consistent with previous studies.
  Some categories of cause-specific mortality, notably cardiovascular disease, also
  follow this pattern, and are more pronounced for certain gender and age groups.
  Our study also suggests that the recent recession contributed to the growth in deaths
  from overdoses of prescription drugs in working-age adults in metropolitan areas.
  Additional research investigating the mechanisms underlying the health consequences
  of macroeconomic conditions is warranted.'
