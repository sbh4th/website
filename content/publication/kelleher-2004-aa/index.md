abstract: "OBJECTIVES: We performed a historical review of cardiovascular risk profiles\
  \ of Irish immigrants to the United States, 1850-1970, in regard to lifestyle, socio-economic\
  \ circumstances, and social capital. METHODS: We analyzed US Census data from 1850-1970,\
  \ area-based social and epidemiological data from Boston, data from Ireland's National\
  \ Nutrition Surveillance Centre, and literature on Irish migration. RESULTS: The\
  \ Irish were consistently at increased risk of cardiovascular diseases, a risk that\
  \ related initially to material deprivation, across the life course of at least\
  \ 2 generations. CONCLUSIONS: The principal difference between the Irish and other\
  \ disadvantaged immigrant groups, such as the Italians, was dietary habits influenced\
  \ by experiences during the Irish famine. Although there was a psychosocial component\
  \ to the disadvantage and discrimination they experienced as an ethnic group, the\
  \ Irish also exhibited strong community networks and support structures that might\
  \ have been expected to counteract discrimination's negative effects. However, the\
  \ Irish's high levels of social capital were not protective for cardiovascular disease."
