abstract: 'Motor vehicle accident (MVA) mortality has been declining overall, but
  little is known about trends by socioeconomic position. We examined trends in education-related
  inequalities in US MVA death rates from 1995 to 2010. We used mortality data from
  the National Center for Health Statistics and population estimates from the Current
  Population Survey, and we calculated vehicle- and person-miles traveled using data
  from the National Household Travel Survey. We used negative binomial regression
  to estimate crude and age-, sex-, and race-adjusted mortality rates among adults
  aged 25 years or more. We found larger mortality decreases among the more highly
  educated and some evidence of mortality increases among the least educated. Adjusted
  death rates were 15.3 per 100,000 population (95% confidence interval (CI): 10.7,
  19.9) higher at the bottom of the education distribution than at the top of the
  education distribution in 1995, increasing to 17.9 per 100,000 population (95% CI:
  14.8, 21.0) by 2010. In relative terms, adjusted death rates were 2.4 (95% CI: 1.7,
  3.0) times higher at the bottom of the education distribution than at the top in
  1995, increasing to 4.3 times higher (95% CI: 3.4, 5.3) by 2010. Inequality increases
  were larger in terms of vehicle-miles traveled. Although overall MVA death rates
  declined during this period, socioeconomic differences in MVA mortality have persisted
  or worsened over time. '
