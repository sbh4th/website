abstract: 'PURPOSE: Colorectal cancer mortality rates dropped by half in the past
  three decades, but these gains were accompanied by striking differences in colorectal
  cancer mortality by socioeconomic status (SES). Our research objective is to examine
  disparities in colorectal cancer mortality by SES, using a scientifically rigorous
  and reproducible approach with publicly available online tools, HD*Calc and NCI
  SES Quintiles. METHODS: All reported colorectal cancer deaths in the United States
  from 1980 to 2010 were categorized into NCI SES quintiles and assessed at the county
  level. Joinpoint was used to test for significant changes in trends. Absolute and
  relative concentration indices (CI) were computed with HD*Calc to graph change in
  disparity over time. RESULTS: Disparities by SES significantly declined until 1993-1995,
  and then increased until 2010, due to a mortality drop in populations living in
  high SES areas that exceeded the mortality drop in lower SES areas. HD*Calc results
  were consistent for both absolute and relative concentration indices. Inequality
  aversion parameter weights of 2, 4, 6 and 8 were compared to explore how much colorectal
  cancer mortality was concentrated in the poorest quintile compared to the richest
  quintile. Weights larger than 4 did not increase the slope of the disparities trend.
  CONCLUSIONS: There is consistent evidence for a significant crossover in colorectal
  cancer disparity from 1980 to 2010. Trends in disparity can be accurately and readily
  summarized using the HD*Calc tool. The disparity trend, combined with published
  information on the timing of screening and treatment uptake, is concordant with
  the idea that introduction of medical screening and treatment leads to lower uptake
  in lower compared to higher SES populations and that differential uptake yields
  disparity in population mortality.'
