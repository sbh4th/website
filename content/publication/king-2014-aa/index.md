abstract: 'We review evidence of determinants contributing to increased opioid-related
  mortality in the United States and Canada between 1990 and 2013. We identified 17
  determinants of opioid-related mortality and mortality increases that we classified
  into 3 categories: prescriber behavior, user behavior and characteristics, and environmental
  and systemic determinants. These determinants operate independently but interact
  in complex ways that vary according to geography and population, making generalization
  from single studies inadvisable. Researchers in this area face significant methodological
  difficulties; most of the studies in our review were ecological or observational
  and lacked control groups or adjustment for confounding factors; thus, causal inferences
  are difficult. Preventing additional opioid-related mortality will likely require
  interventions that address multiple determinants and are tailored to specific locations
  and populations. '
