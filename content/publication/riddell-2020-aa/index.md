abstract: Seat belt laws have increased seat belt use in the US and contributed to
  reduced fatalities and injuries. However, these policies provide the potential for
  increased discrimination. The objective of this study is to determine whether a
  change in seat belt use enforcement led to a differential change in the number of
  stops, arrests, and searches to White, Black and Hispanic drivers in one US state.
  We used data on 1,091,424 traffic stops conducted by state troopers in South Carolina
  in 2005 and 2006 to examine how the change from secondary to primary enforcement
  of seat belt use in December 2005 affected the number of stops, arrests, and searches
  to White, Black, and Hispanic drivers using quasi-Poisson and logistic regressions.
  We found that the policy led to a 50% increase in the number of non-speeding stops
  for White drivers, and that this increase was 5% larger among Black drivers [RR
  (95% CI) = 1.05 (1.00, 1.10)], but not larger among Hispanic drivers [1.00 (0.93,
  1.08)]. The policy decreased arrests and searches among non-speeding stops, with
  larger decreases for Black vs. White drivers [RR searches = 0.86 (0.81, 0.91) and
  RR arrests = 0.90 (0.85, 0.96)]. For Hispanic drivers, effects of the policy change
  were also found among stops for speeding, which failed the falsification test and
  suggested that other changes likely affected this group. These findings may support
  the hypothesis of differential enforcement of seat belt policy in South Carolina
  for Black and White drivers.
