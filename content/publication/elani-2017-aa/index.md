abstract: "OBJECTIVES: To conduct cross-national comparison of education-based inequalities\
  \ in tooth loss across Australia, Canada, Chile, New Zealand and the United States.\
  \ METHODS: We used nationally representative data from Australia's National Survey\
  \ of Adult Oral Health; Canadian Health Measures Survey; Chile's First National\
  \ Health Survey Ministry of Health; US National Health and Nutrition Examination\
  \ Survey; and the New Zealand Oral Health Survey. We examined the prevalence of\
  \ edentulism, the proportion of individuals having <21 teeth and the mean number\
  \ of teeth present. We used education as a measure of socioeconomic position and\
  \ measured absolute and relative inequalities. We used random-effects meta-analysis\
  \ to summarize inequality estimates. RESULTS: The USA showed the widest absolute\
  \ and relative inequality in edentulism prevalence, whereas Chile demonstrated the\
  \ largest absolute and relative social inequality gradient for the mean number of\
  \ teeth present. Australia had the narrowest absolute and relative inequality gap\
  \ for proportion of individuals having <21 teeth. Pooled estimates showed substantial\
  \ heterogeneity for both absolute and relative inequality measures. CONCLUSIONS:\
  \ There is a considerable variation in the magnitude of inequalities in tooth loss\
  \ across the countries included in this analysis."
