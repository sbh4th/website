abstract: 'OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to measure state trends in educational
  inequalities in smoking, binge alcohol use, physical inactivity, obesity, and seatbelt
  use. METHODS: The authors calculated the Relative Concentration Index of educational
  inequality for five health behaviors on adults from all 50 states and the District
  of Columbia using data from 1990 to 2004 in the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance
  System (n=2,118,562). Linear regression was used to measure changes and trends in
  the Relative Concentration Index of health inequality across education groups in
  each state. RESULTS: Except for binge alcohol use, poorer health behaviors were
  concentrated among the less educated. The largest educational inequalities were
  for physical inactivity. From 1990 to 2004, significant increases in relative educational
  inequalities occurred in 40 states for smoking and 31 states for physical inactivity.
  For binge alcohol use, 27 states showed significant declining inequality trends,
  but educational inequalities reversed direction and binge alcohol use is now more
  prevalent among the less educated in 19 states. Significant decreases in educational
  inequalities occurred in 36 states for obesity and 24 states for seat belt use.
  Changes in educational inequalities across the different health behaviors were not
  associated, except for a modest correlation between changes in inequality in smoking
  and binge alcohol use (r=0.40; p=0.004). Similarly, there was little association
  between changes in the population prevalence of health behaviors and changes in
  educational inequality in health behaviors, with substantial heterogeneity among
  states. CONCLUSIONS: State trends in relative educational inequality among health
  behaviors were mixed, increasing for smoking and physical inactivity and decreasing
  for obesity and seat belt use. The factors influencing relative inequality trends
  may differ from those affecting overall prevalence trends.'
