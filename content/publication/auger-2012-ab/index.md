abstract: 'PURPOSE: Time trends in educational inequalities in small-for-gestational-age
  (SGA) birth are important to evaluate for policy, especially at preterm gestational
  ages when morbidity and mortality are typically greater. We evaluated educational
  inequalities in preterm and term SGA birth over time, accounting for potential bias
  at preterm gestational ages. METHODS: Data included 2,204,056 singleton live births
  from 25 to 43 gestational weeks, 1981 to 2007. We estimated prevalence ratios (PR)
  and percent prevalence differences (PPD) of preterm and term SGA birth for a continuous
  education score, accounting for maternal characteristics. Sensitivity analyses included
  correction for misclassification of preterm SGA status, and use of fetuses-at-risk
  denominators in regression models. RESULTS: Although prevalence of SGA birth decreased
  over time, relative educational inequalities (PRs) persisted for preterm and term
  cases. PPDs decreased slightly, but more for term than preterm SGA birth. Sensitivity
  analyses indicated that PRs for education were stronger for preterm than term SGA
  birth. PPDs were larger for term SGA birth in the first period, but greater for
  preterm SGA birth in the last period. CONCLUSIONS: Relative educational inequalities
  in SGA birth persisted over time. The difference in prevalence between the least
  and most educated mothers is currently greater for preterm than for term SGA birth.'
