abstract: "Agency, the ability to identify goals and then act upon them, is a core\
  \ component of women's empowerment and has important implications for the rights\
  \ and well-being of women and girls. However, inadequate measurement of agency impedes\
  \ empirical investigation, and few studies have investigated the relation between\
  \ agency and health. Using a theory-based measure of women's agency, we investigated\
  \ the longitudinal association between agency and mental distress among women living\
  \ in rural Rajasthan, India. Women completed baseline interviews between June and\
  \ October 2016 and follow-up interviews between June and November 2017 (n = 2859).\
  \ We measured mental distress with the Hindi version of the 12 item General Health\
  \ Questionnaire, which asked women 12 questions about symptoms of mental distress\
  \ (score range: 0-12). We measured agency using a measurement model which was composed\
  \ of 23 indicators tapping into four domains of agency and validated in a prior\
  \ research study. We modeled the relation between women's agency and mental distress\
  \ using Poisson regression and an individual-level fixed effects approach to account\
  \ for time-fixed characteristics of individuals. In models that controlled for time-varying\
  \ confounding (e.g., household wealth, number of sons), a one standard deviation\
  \ increase in agency was associated with a reduction of 0.21 distress symptoms (95%\
  \ CI: -0.32, -0.09), which corresponds to a 7% reduction (95% CI: 3%, 11%) relative\
  \ to the mean. We found that specific domains of agency varied in their association\
  \ with mental distress; namely, an increase in women's agency regarding her attitudes\
  \ about gender norms corresponded to a reduction in mental distress, whereas an\
  \ increase in women's agency regarding speaking up in public corresponded to an\
  \ increase in mental distress. Our research demonstrates that agency may be a determinant\
  \ of mental health and that comprehensive measurement can reveal nuanced relationships."
