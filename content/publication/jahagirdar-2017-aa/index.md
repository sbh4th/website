abstract: "Background: Despite recent improvements, low height-for-age, a key indicator\
  \ of inadequate child nutrition, is an ongoing public health issue in low-income\
  \ and middle-income countries. Paid maternity leave has the potential to improve\
  \ child nutrition, but few studies have estimated its impact. Methods: We used data\
  \ from 583 227 children younger than 5 years in 37 countries surveyed as part of\
  \ the Demographic and Health Surveys (2000-2014) to compare the change in children's\
  \ height-for-age z score in five countries that increased their legislated duration\
  \ of paid maternity leave (Uganda, Zambia, Zimbabwe, Bangladesh and Lesotho) relative\
  \ to 32 other countries that did not. A quasiexperimental difference-in-difference\
  \ design involving a linear regression of height-for-age z score on the number of\
  \ weeks of legislated paid maternity leave was used. We included fixed effects for\
  \ country and birth year to control for, respectively, fixed country characteristics\
  \ and shared trends in height-for-age, and adjusted for time-varying covariates\
  \ such as gross domestic product per capita and the female labour force participation\
  \ rate. Results: The mean height-for-age z scores in the pretreatment period were\
  \ -1.91 (SD=1.44) and -1.47 (SD=1.57) in countries that did and did not change their\
  \ policies, respectively. The scores increased in treated and control countries\
  \ over time. A 1-month increase in legislated paid maternity leave was associated\
  \ with a decrease of 0.08(95% CI -0.20 to 0.04) in child height-for-age z score.\
  \ Sensitivity analyses did not support a robust association between paid maternity\
  \ leave policies and height-for-age z score. Conclusion: We found little evidence\
  \ that recent changes in legislated paid maternity leave have been sufficient to\
  \ affect child height-for-age z scores. The relatively short durations of leave,\
  \ the potential for low coverage and the strong increasing trend in children's growth\
  \ may explain our findings. Future studies considering longer durations or combined\
  \ interventions may reveal further insight to support policy."
