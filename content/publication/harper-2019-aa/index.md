abstract: 'BACKGROUND: For policy questions where substantial empirical background
  information exists, conventional frequentist policy analysis is hard to justify.
  Bayesian analysis quantitatively incorporates prior knowledge, but is not often
  used in applied policy analysis. METHODS: We combined 2000-2016 data from the Fatal
  Analysis Reporting System with priors based on past empirical studies and policy
  documents to study the impact of mandatory seat belt laws on traffic fatalities.
  We used a Bayesian data augmentation approach to combine information from prior
  studies with difference-in-differences analyses of recent law changes to provide
  updated evidence on the impact that upgrading to primary enforcement of seat belt
  laws has on fatalities. RESULTS: After incorporating the evidence from past studies,
  we find limited evidence to support the hypothesis that recent policy upgrades affect
  fatality rates. We estimate that upgrading to primary enforcement reduced fatality
  rates by 0.37 deaths per billion vehicle miles traveled (95% posterior interval
  -0.90, 0.16), or a rate ratio of 0.96 (95% posterior interval 0.91, 1.02), and increased
  the proportion of decedents reported as wearing seat belts by 7 percentage points
  (95% posterior interval 5, 8), or a risk ratio of 1.18 (95% posterior interval 1.13,
  1.24). CONCLUSIONS: Bayesian methods can provide credible estimates of future policy
  impacts, especially for policy questions that occur in dynamic environments, such
  as traffic safety.'
