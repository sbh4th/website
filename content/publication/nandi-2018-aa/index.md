abstract: "Policy Points: Historically, reforms that have increased the duration of\
  \ job-protected paid parental leave have improved women's economic outcomes. By\
  \ targeting the period around childbirth, access to paid parental leave also appears\
  \ to reduce rates of infant mortality, with breastfeeding representing one potential\
  \ mechanism. The provision of more generous paid leave entitlements in countries\
  \ that offer unpaid or short durations of paid leave could help families strike\
  \ a balance between the competing demands of earning income and attending to personal\
  \ and family well-being. CONTEXT: Policies legislating paid leave from work for\
  \ new parents, and to attend to individual and family illness, are common across\
  \ Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries. However,\
  \ there exists no comprehensive review of their potential impacts on economic, social,\
  \ and health outcomes. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review of the peer-reviewed\
  \ literature on paid leave and socioeconomic and health outcomes. We reviewed 5,538\
  \ abstracts and selected 85 published papers on the impact of parental leave policies,\
  \ 22 papers on the impact of medical leave policies, and 2 papers that evaluated\
  \ both types of policies. We synthesized the main findings through a narrative description;\
  \ a meta-analysis was precluded by heterogeneity in policy attributes, policy changes,\
  \ outcomes, and study designs. FINDINGS: We were able to draw several conclusions\
  \ about the impact of parental leave policies. First, extensions in the duration\
  \ of paid parental leave to between 6 and 12 months were accompanied by attendant\
  \ increases in leave-taking and longer durations of leave. Second, there was little\
  \ evidence that extending the duration of paid leave had negative employment or\
  \ economic consequences. Third, unpaid leave does not appear to confer the same\
  \ benefits as paid leave. Fourth, from a population health perspective, increases\
  \ in paid parental leave were consistently associated with better infant and child\
  \ health, particularly in terms of lower mortality rates. Fifth, paid paternal leave\
  \ policies of adequate length and generosity have induced fathers to take additional\
  \ time off from work following the birth of a child. How medical leave policies\
  \ for personal or family illness influence health has not been widely studied. CONCLUSIONS:\
  \ There is substantial quasi-experimental evidence to support expansions in the\
  \ duration of job-protected paid parental leave as an instrument for supporting\
  \ women's labor force participation, safeguarding women's incomes and earnings,\
  \ and improving child survival. This has implications, in particular, for countries\
  \ that offer shorter durations of job-protected paid leave or lack a national paid\
  \ leave entitlement altogether."
