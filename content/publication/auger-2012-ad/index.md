abstract: Language is an important determinant of health, but analyses of linguistic
  inequalities in mortality are scant, especially for Canadian linguistic groups with
  European roots. We evaluated the life expectancy gap between the Francophone majority
  and Anglophone minority of Québec, Canada, both over time and across major provincial
  areas. Arriaga's method was used to estimate the age and cause of death groups contributing
  to changes in the life expectancy gap at birth between 1989-1993 and 2002-2006,
  and to evaluate patterns across major provincial areas (metropolitan Montréal, other
  metropolitan centres, and small cities/rural areas). Life expectancy at birth was
  greater for Anglophones, but the gap decreased over time by 1.3 years (52% decline)
  in men and 0.9 years (47% decline) in women, due to relatively sharper reductions
  in Francophone mortality from several causes, except lung cancer which countered
  reductions in women. The life expectancy gap in 2002-2006 was widest in other metropolitan
  centres (men 5.1 years, women 3.2 years), narrowest in small cities/rural areas
  (men 0.8 years, women 0.7 years), and tobacco-related causes were the main contributors.
  Only young Anglophones <40 years in small cities/rural areas had mortality higher
  than Francophones, resulting in a narrower gap in these areas. Differentials in
  life expectancy favouring Anglophones decreased over time, but varied across areas
  of Québec. Tobacco-related causes accounted for the majority of the current life
  expectancy gap.
