abstract: Reducing health inequalities is a key objective for many governments and
  public health organizations. Whether inequalities are measured on the absolute (difference)
  or relative (ratio) scale can have a significant impact on judgments about whether
  health inequalities are increasing or decreasing, but both of these measures are
  not often presented in empirical studies. In this study we investigated the impact
  of selective presentation of health inequality measures on judgments of health inequality
  trends among 40 university undergraduates. We randomized participants to see either
  a difference or ratio measure of health inequality alongside raw mortality rates
  in 5 different scenarios. At baseline there were no differences between treatment
  groups in assessments of inequality trends, but selective exposure to the same raw
  data augmented with ratio versus difference inequality graphs altered participants'
  assessments of inequality change. When absolute inequality decreased and relative
  inequality increased, exposure to ratio measures increased the probability of concluding
  that inequality had increased from 32.5% to 70%, but exposure to difference measures
  did not (35% vs. 25%). Selective exposure to ratio versus difference inequality
  graphs thus increased the difference between groups in concluding that inequality
  had increased from 2.5% (95% CI -9.5% to 14.5%) to 45% (95% CI 29.4 to 60.6). A
  similar pattern was evident for other scenarios where absolute and relative inequality
  trends gave conflicting results. In cases where measures of absolute and relative
  inequality both increased or both decreased, we did not find any evidence that assignment
  to ratio vs. difference graphs had an impact on assessments of inequality change.
  Selective reporting of measures of health inequality has the potential to create
  biased judgments of progress in ameliorating health inequalities.
