abstract: 'CONTEXT: Quantitative estimates of the magnitude, direction, and rate of
  change of health inequalities play a crucial role in creating and assessing policies
  aimed at eliminating the disproportionate burden of disease in disadvantaged populations.
  It is generally assumed that the measurement of health inequalities is a value-neutral
  process, providing objective data that are then interpreted using normative judgments
  about whether a particular distribution of health is just, fair, or socially acceptable.
  METHODS: We discuss five examples in which normative judgments play a role in the
  measurement process itself, through either the selection of one measurement strategy
  to the exclusion of others or the selection of the type, significance, or weight
  assigned to the variables being measured. FINDINGS: Overall, we find that many commonly
  used measures of inequality are value laden and that the normative judgments implicit
  in these measures have important consequences for interpreting and responding to
  health inequalities. CONCLUSIONS: Because values implicit in the generation of health
  inequality measures may lead to radically different interpretations of the same
  underlying data,we urge researchers to explicitly consider and transparently discuss
  the normative judgments underlying their measures. We also urge policymakers and
  other consumers of health inequalities data to pay close attention to the measures
  on which they base their assessments of current and future health policies.'
