abstract: Equity monitoring is a priority for Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, and for
  those implementing The2030 agenda for sustainable development. For its new phase
  of operations, Gavi reassessed its approach to monitoring equity in vaccination
  coverage. To help inform this effort, we made a systematic analysis of inequalities
  in vaccination coverage across 45 Gavi-supported countries and compared results
  from different measurement approaches. Based on our findings, we formulated recommendations
  for Gavi's equity monitoring approach. The approach involved defining the vulnerable
  populations, choosing appropriate measures to quantify inequalities, and defining
  equity benchmarks that reflect the ambitions of the sustainable development agenda.
  In this article, we explain the rationale for the recommendations and for the development
  of an improved equity monitoring tool. Gavi's previous approach to measuring equity
  was the difference in vaccination coverage between a country's richest and poorest
  wealth quintiles. In addition to the wealth index, we recommend monitoring other
  dimensions of vulnerability (maternal education, place of residence, child sex and
  the multidimensional poverty index). For dimensions with multiple subgroups, measures
  of inequality that consider information on all subgroups should be used. We also
  recommend that both absolute and relative measures of inequality be tracked over
  time. Finally, we propose that equity benchmarks target complete elimination of
  inequalities. To facilitate equity monitoring, we recommend the use of a data display
  tool - the equity dashboard - to support decision-making in the sustainable development
  period. We highlight its key advantages using data from Côte d'Ivoire and Haiti.
