abstract: "PURPOSE: High work demands might be a determinant of poor mental health\
  \ among women in low- and middle-income countries, especially in rural settings\
  \ where women experience greater amounts of labor-intensive unpaid work. Research\
  \ originating from such settings is lacking. METHODS: We estimated the cross-sectional\
  \ association between work demands and mental distress among 3177 women living in\
  \ 160 predominantly tribal communities in southern Rajasthan, India. A structured\
  \ questionnaire captured the number of minutes women spent on various activities\
  \ in the last 24 h, and we used this information to measure women's work demands,\
  \ including the total work amount, nature of work (e.g., housework), and type of\
  \ work (e.g., cooking). Mental distress was measured with the Hindi version of the\
  \ 12-item General Health Questionnaire. We used negative binomial regression models\
  \ to estimate the association between work demands (amount, nature, and type) and\
  \ mental distress. RESULTS: On average, women spent more than 9.5 h a day on work\
  \ activities. The most time, intensive work activity was caring for children, the\
  \ elderly, or disabled (149 min). In adjusted models, we found a U-shaped association\
  \ between work amount and mental distress. High amounts of housework were associated\
  \ with higher distress, whereas paid work and farmwork amount were not. Certain\
  \ types of housework, including collecting water and cleaning, were associated with\
  \ increased distress scores. CONCLUSIONS: We found an association between aspects\
  \ of work demands and mental distress. Research in other contexts where women perform\
  \ high amounts of unpaid work, particularly within the home or farm, is warranted."
