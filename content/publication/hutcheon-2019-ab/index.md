abstract: Numerous observational studies have shown that infants born after short
  interpregnancy intervals (the interval between birth and subsequent conception)
  are more likely to experience adverse perinatal outcomes than infants born following
  longer intervals. Yet it remains controversial whether the link between short interpregnancy
  interval and adverse outcomes is causal or is confounded by factors such as low
  socioeconomic position, inadequate access to health care, and unintended pregnancy.
  Sibling comparison studies, which use a woman as her own control by comparing exposure
  and outcome status of her different pregnancies (i.e., comparing sibling offspring),
  have gained popularity as a strategy to reduce confounding by these difficult-to-measure
  factors that are nevertheless relatively stable within women. A variant of this
  approach, used by Regan et al. (Am J Epidemiol. 2019;188(1):9-16) and reported in
  this issue of the Journal, is a maternally matched design based on a single interpregnancy
  interval per woman. Using real and simulated data, we highlight underappreciated
  shortcomings of these designs that could limit the validity of study findings. In
  particular, we illustrate how the single-interval variant appears to derive estimates
  from comparisons between different mothers, not within mothers. Future studies of
  optimal birth spacing using sibling comparison designs should examine in detail
  the potential consequences of these methodological limitations.
