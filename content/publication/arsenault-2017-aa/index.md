abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Important inequalities in childhood vaccination coverage persist
  between countries and population groups. Understanding why some countries achieve
  higher and more equitable levels of coverage is crucial to redress these inequalities.
  In this study, we explored the country-level determinants of (1) coverage of the
  third dose of diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis- (DTP3) containing vaccine and (2) within-country
  inequalities in DTP3 coverage in 45 countries supported by Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance.
  METHODS: We used data from the most recent Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS)
  conducted between 2005 and 2014. We measured national DTP3 coverage and the slope
  index of inequality in DTP3 coverage with respect to household wealth, maternal
  education, and multidimensional poverty. We collated data on country health systems,
  health financing, governance and geographic and sociocultural contexts from published
  sources. We used meta-regressions to assess the relationship between these country-level
  factors and variations in DTP3 coverage and inequalities. To validate our findings,
  we repeated these analyses for coverage with measles-containing vaccine (MCV). RESULTS:
  We found considerable heterogeneity in DTP3 coverage and in the magnitude of inequalities
  across countries. Results for MCV were consistent with those from DTP3. Political
  stability, gender equality and smaller land surface were important predictors of
  higher and more equitable levels of DTP3 coverage. Inequalities in DTP3 coverage
  were also lower in countries receiving more external resources for health, with
  lower rates of out-of-pocket spending and with higher national coverage. Greater
  government spending on heath and lower linguistic fractionalization were also consistent
  with better vaccination outcomes. CONCLUSION: Improving vaccination coverage and
  reducing inequalities requires that policies and programs address critical social
  determinants of health including geographic and social exclusion, gender inequality
  and the availability of financial protection for health. Further research should
  investigate the mechanisms contributing to these associations.'
