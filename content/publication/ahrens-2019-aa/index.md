abstract: "BACKGROUND: The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that women wait\
  \ at least 24 months after a livebirth before attempting a subsequent pregnancy\
  \ to reduce the risk of adverse maternal, perinatal, and infant health outcomes.\
  \ However, the applicability of the WHO recommendations for women in the United\
  \ States is unclear, as breast feeding, nutrition, maternal age at first birth,\
  \ and total fertility rate differs substantially between the United States and the\
  \ low- and middle-resource countries upon which most of the evidence is based. METHODS:\
  \ To inform guideline development for birth spacing specific to women in the United\
  \ States, the Office of Population Affairs (OPA) convened an expert work group meeting\
  \ in Washington, DC, on 14-15 September 2017 among reproductive, perinatal, paediatric,\
  \ social, and public health epidemiologists; obstetrician-gynaecologists; biostatisticians;\
  \ and experts in evidence synthesis related to women's health. RESULTS: Presentations\
  \ and discussion topics included the methodological quality of existing studies,\
  \ evaluation of the evidence for causal effects of short interpregnancy intervals\
  \ on adverse perinatal and maternal health outcomes, good practices for future research,\
  \ and identification of research gaps and priorities for future work. CONCLUSIONS:\
  \ This report provides an overview of the presentations, discussions, and conclusions\
  \ from the expert work group meeting."
