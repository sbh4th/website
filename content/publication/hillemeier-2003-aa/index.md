abstract: 'OBJECTIVE: To conceptualize and measure community contextual influences
  on population health and health disparities. DATA SOURCES: We use traditional and
  nontraditional secondary sources of data comprising a comprehensive array of community
  characteristics. STUDY DESIGN: Using a consultative process, we identify 12 overarching
  dimensions of contextual characteristics that may affect community health, as well
  as specific subcomponents relating to each dimension. DATA COLLECTION: An extensive
  geocoded library of data indicators relating to each dimension and subcomponent
  for metropolitan areas in the United States is assembled. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We
  describe the development of community contextual health profiles, present the rationale
  supporting each of the profile dimensions, and provide examples of relevant data
  sources. CONCLUSIONS: Our conceptual framework for community contextual characteristics,
  including a specified set of dimensions and components, can provide practical ways
  to monitor health-related aspects of the economic, social, and physical environments
  in which people live. We suggest several guiding principles useful for understanding
  how aspects of contextual characteristics can affect health and health disparities.'
