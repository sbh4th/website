abstract: "OBJECTIVE: To assess international shortfall inequality in life expectancy\
  \ at birth among women and men and the influence of geography and country income\
  \ group. METHODS: The authors used estimates of life expectancy at birth, by sex,\
  \ for 12 five-year periods between 1950-1955 and 2005-2010 and estimates of population\
  \ for the midpoints of each period from the World population prospects, 2008 revision.\
  \ Shortfall inequality was defined as the weighted average of the deviations of\
  \ each country's average life expectancy by sex from the highest attained life expectancy\
  \ by sex for each period. FINDINGS: International shortfall inequalities in life\
  \ expectancy among men and among women decreased between 1950 and 1975 but stagnated\
  \ thereafter. International shortfall inequality in life expectancy has been higher\
  \ in women than in men, ranging from 1.9 to 2.9 years. Women in low-income countries\
  \ have the biggest shortfall, currently at around 26.7 years. CONCLUSION: International\
  \ shortfall inequality is higher among women than men primarily because women in\
  \ low-income and lower-middle-income country groups show larger differences in life\
  \ expectancy than men. Further investigation is needed to determine the pathways\
  \ causing these inequalities."
