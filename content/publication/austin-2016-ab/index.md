abstract: "BACKGROUND: Replication is a vital part of the research process and has\
  \ recently received considerable attention. Analyses using publicly available data\
  \ should, if adequately described, be reproducible without assistance from the original\
  \ investigators. Using data from the US National Health and Nutrition Examination\
  \ Survey (NHANES), a recent study reported a statistically significant difference\
  \ in cardiovascular disease risk comparing subgroups of sexual minority men. We\
  \ attempted to reproduce these findings and assessed whether the results were robust\
  \ to alternative analytic strategies and assumptions. METHODS: We used the exclusion\
  \ criteria and coding strategy described in the original paper to construct our\
  \ analytical data set. Sampling weights were constructed in accordance with NHANES\
  \ analytical guidelines. We estimated crude and covariate-adjusted associations\
  \ between sexual orientation and vascular age using the regression models specified\
  \ in the original report. We also conducted a series of sensitivity analyses to\
  \ improve on the original findings. RESULTS: Our replication attempt was partially\
  \ successful: we replicated the general trends reported in the original analysis,\
  \ but not identical effect estimates. Importantly, we identified a potential misapplication\
  \ of the Framingham Risk Score; correcting for this increased the probability that\
  \ the reported null hypothesis test was a type I error. CONCLUSIONS: This paper\
  \ supports the recent calls for greater transparency and improved reporting in research.\
  \ Even with a publicly available and well-documented data source, we were unable\
  \ to exactly replicate another study's original findings. Our sensitivity analyses\
  \ revealed key issues in the original analysis and demonstrate the scientific importance\
  \ of research replication."
