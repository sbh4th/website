abstract: "BACKGROUND: The provision of affordable and reliable daycare services is\
  \ a potentially important policy lever for empowering Indian women. Access to daycare\
  \ might reduce barriers to labor force entry and generate economic opportunities\
  \ for women, improve education for girls caring for younger siblings, and promote\
  \ nutrition and learning among children. However, empirical evidence concerning\
  \ the effects of daycare programs in low-and-middle-income countries is scarce.\
  \ This cluster-randomized trial will estimate the effect of a community-based daycare\
  \ program on health and economic well-being over the life-course among women and\
  \ children living in rural Rajasthan, India. METHODS: This three-year study takes\
  \ place in rural communities from five blocks in the Udaipur District of rural Rajasthan.\
  \ The intervention is the introduction of a full-time, affordable, community-based\
  \ daycare program. At baseline, 3177 mothers with age eligible children living in\
  \ 160 village hamlets were surveyed. After the baseline, these hamlets were randomized\
  \ to the intervention or control groups and respondents will be interviewed on two\
  \ more occasions. Primary social and economic outcomes include women's economic\
  \ status and economic opportunity, women's empowerment, and children's educational\
  \ attainment. Primary health outcomes include women's mental health, as well as\
  \ children's nutritional status. DISCUSSION: This interdisciplinary research initiative\
  \ will provide rigorous evidence concerning the effects of daycare in lower-income\
  \ settings. In doing so it will address an important research gap and has the potential\
  \ to inform policies for improving the daycare system in India in ways that promote\
  \ health and economic well-being. TRIAL REGISTRATION: (1) The ISRCTN clinical trial\
  \ registry (ISRCTN45369145), http://www.isrctn.com/ISRCTN45369145 , registered on\
  \ May 16, 2016 and (2) The American Economic Association's registry for randomized\
  \ controlled trials (AEARCTR-0000774), http://www.socialscienceregistry.org/trials/774\
  \ , registered on July 15, 2015."
