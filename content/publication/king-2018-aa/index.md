abstract: 'BACKGROUND: The Global Burden of Disease (GBD) project systematically assesses
  mortality, healthy life expectancy, and disability across 195 countries and territories,
  using the disability-adjusted life year (DALY). Disability weights in the DALY are
  based upon surveys that ask users to rate health states based on lay descriptions.
  We conducted an experimental study to examine whether the inclusion or removal of
  psychological, social, or familial implications from a health state description
  might affect individual judgments about disease severity, and thus relative disability
  weights. METHODS: We designed a survey consisting of 36 paired descriptions in which
  information about plausible psychological, social, or familial implications of a
  health condition was either present or absent. Using a Web-based platform, we recruited
  1,592 participants, who were assigned to one of two experimental groups, each of
  which were asked to assign a value to the health state description from 0 to 100
  using a slider, with 0 as the \"worst possible health\" and 100 as the \"best possible
  health.\" We tested five hypotheses: (1) the inclusion of psychological, social,
  or familial consequences in health state descriptions will reduce the average rating
  of a health state; (2) the effect will be stronger for diseases with lower disability
  weights (i.e., less severe diseases); (3) the effect will vary across the type of
  additional information added to the health state description; (4) the impact of
  adding information on familial consequences will be stronger for female than male;
  (5) the effect of additional consequences on ratings of health state descriptions
  will not differ by levels of completed education and age. RESULTS: On average, adding
  social, psychological, or familial consequences to the health state description
  lowered individual ratings of that description by 0.78 points. The impact of adding
  information had a stronger impact on ratings of the least severe conditions, reducing
  average ratings in this category by 1.67 points. Addition of information about child-rearing
  had the strongest impact, reducing average ratings by 2.09 points. We found little
  evidence that the effect of adding information on ratings of health descriptions
  varied by gender, education, or age. CONCLUSIONS: Including information about health
  states not directly related to major functional consequences or symptoms, particularly
  with respect to child-rearing and specifically for descriptions of less severe conditions,
  can lead to lower ratings of health. However, this impact was not consistent across
  all conditions or types of information, and was most pronounced for inclusion of
  information about child-rearing, and among the least severe conditions.'
