abstract: The impact of legislated minimum wages on the early-life health of children
  living in low and middle-income countries has not been examined. For our analyses,
  we used data from the Demographic and Household Surveys (DHS) from 57 countries
  conducted between 1999 and 2013. Our analyses focus on height-for-age z scores (HAZ)
  for children under 5 years of age who were surveyed as part of the DHS. To identify
  the causal effect of minimum wages, we utilized plausibly exogenous variation in
  the legislated minimum wages during each child's year of birth, the identifying
  assumption being that mothers do not time their births around changes in the minimum
  wage. As a sensitivity exercise, we also made within family comparisons (mother
  fixed effect models). Our final analysis on 49 countries reveal that a 1% increase
  in minimum wages was associated with 0.1% (95% CI = -0.2, 0) decrease in HAZ scores.
  Adverse effects of an increase in the minimum wage were observed among girls and
  for children of fathers who were less than 35 years old, mothers aged 20-29, parents
  who were married, parents who were less educated, and parents involved in manual
  work. We also explored heterogeneity by region and GDP per capita at baseline (1999).
  Adverse effects were concentrated in lower-income countries and were most pronounced
  in South Asia. By contrast, increases in the minimum wage improved children's HAZ
  in Latin America, and among children of parents working in a skilled sector. Our
  findings are inconsistent with the hypothesis that increases in the minimum wage
  unconditionally improve child health in lower-income countries, and highlight heterogeneity
  in the impact of minimum wages around the globe. Future work should involve country
  and occupation specific studies which can explore not only different outcomes such
  as infant mortality rates, but also explore the role of parental investments in
  shaping these effects.
