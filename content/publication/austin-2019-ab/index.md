abstract: 'OBJECTIVES: In this paper, we estimate the average effect of two common
  TRAP (targeted regulation of abortion providers) laws on abortion rates using a
  novel longitudinal database of state-level policy shifts. STUDY DESIGN: We merged
  several sources of policy, abortion, and sociodemographic data from 1991-2014. We
  used a difference-in-differences design to control for time-fixed state-level characteristics
  and common factors affecting abortion trends across all states, as well as measured
  time-varying state-level factors that may impact TRAP enforcement and abortion rates.
  We used generalized linear models with cluster-robust standard errors to obtain
  our estimates. RESULTS: Enforcement of ambulatory surgical center (ASC) laws reduced
  the abortion rate by 1.25 abortions per 1000 women aged 15-44 (95% CI: -3.39, .89),
  and admitting privilege laws increased the abortion rate by .57 abortions per 1000
  women aged 15-44 (95% CI: -.68, 1.83), but neither effect was statistically distinguishable
  from zero. Our findings were robust to the inclusion of covariates and various sensitivity
  analyses. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that ASC and admitting privilege laws
  did not, on average, lead to a meaningful change in abortion rates. IMPLICATIONS:
  US abortion rates are currently at record lows, but our findings suggest that TRAP
  laws are not a meaningful driver of this trend. However, this does not mean that
  these laws are without consequence in a particular state (or a given year). Researchers
  should assess the average long-run impact of TRAP laws on other outcomes in the
  future.'
