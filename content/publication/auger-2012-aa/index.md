abstract: 'OBJECTIVES: We evaluated temporal and regional inequalities in adverse
  birth outcomes between Anglophones and Francophones of a Canadian province. METHODS:
  Odds ratios and rate differences in preterm birth (PTB, <37 gestational weeks) and
  small-for-gestational-age (SGA) birth were computed for Anglophones relative to
  Francophones for singleton live births in Québec from 1981 to 2008 (N = 2,292,237),
  adjusting for maternal characteristics. Trends over time and residential region
  were evaluated. RESULTS: Rates of PTB and SGA birth overall were lower for Anglophones
  relative to Francophones, but temporal and regional trends varied by outcome. Although
  PTB rates increased over time, inequalities between Francophones and Anglophones
  were relatively stable. In contrast, inequalities in SGA birth narrowed over time
  as Francophone rates declined more than Anglophones. Inequalities in SGA birth favored
  Anglophones overall, but the gap gradually reversed in Montréal (the largest metropolitan
  center) to currently favor Francophones. CONCLUSIONS: PTB and SGA birth rates favored
  Anglophones over Francophones. The linguistic gap was generally stable over time
  for PTB, but narrowed or reversed for SGA birth. Language may be used to capture
  inequalities in perinatal health in countries where different linguistic groups
  predominate.'
