abstract: 'BACKGROUND: In recent decades, many smaller hospitals in British Columbia,
  Canada, have stopped providing planned obstetric services. We examined the effect
  of these service closures on the labour and delivery outcomes of pregnant women
  living in affected communities. METHODS: We used maternal postal codes to identify
  delivery records (1998-2014) of women residing in a community affected by service
  closure. The records were obtained from the British Columbia Perinatal Data Registry.
  We examined the effect of the closures using a within-communities fixed-effects
  framework and included similar-sized communities without service closures to control
  for underlying time trends. The primary outcome was a previously published composite
  measure of labour and delivery safety, the Adverse Outcome Index, which includes
  adverse events such as birth injury and unanticipated operative procedures, and
  includes weights for severity of adverse events. Secondary outcomes included maternal
  or newborn transfer, and use of obstetric interventions. RESULTS: We found little
  evidence that closure of planned obstetric services affected the risk of composite
  adverse maternal-newborn outcome (-0.4 excess adverse events per 100 deliveries,
  95% confidence interval [CI] -2.0 to 1.1), or most other secondary outcomes. The
  severity of composite outcome events decreased following the closures (rate ratio
  0.58, 95% CI 0.36 to 0.89). Closures were associated with increases in use of epidural
  analgesia (3.4 excess events per 100 deliveries, 95% CI 0.4 to 6.3) and length of
  antepartum stay (0.6 h, 95% CI 0.1 to 1.0 h). INTERPRETATION: Closure of planned
  obstetric services in low-volume hospitals was not associated with an increase or
  decrease in frequency of adverse events during labour and delivery.'
