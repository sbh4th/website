abstract: "BACKGROUND: Antenatal corticosteroids reduce respiratory morbidity in preterm\
  \ infants, but their use during late preterm gestation (34-36 weeks) is limited\
  \ because their safety for longer-term child neurodevelopment is unclear. We sought\
  \ to determine if fetuses with higher probability of exposure to antenatal corticosteroids\
  \ had increased rates of prescriptions for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder\
  \ (ADHD) medication in childhood, using a quasiexperimental design that better controls\
  \ for confounding than existing observational studies. METHODS: We identified 16\
  \ 358 children whose birthing parents were admitted for delivery between 31 + 0\
  \ (31 weeks, 0 days) and 36 + 6 weeks' gestation in 2000-2013, using a perinatal\
  \ data registry from British Columbia, Canada, and linked their records with population-based\
  \ child ADHD medication data (2000-2018). We used a regression discontinuity design\
  \ to capitalize on the fact that pregnancies presenting for delivery immediately\
  \ before and immediately after the clinical cut-off for antenatal corticosteroid\
  \ administration of 34 + 0 weeks' gestation have very different levels of exposure\
  \ to corticosteroids, but are otherwise similar with respect to confounders. RESULTS:\
  \ Over a median follow-up period of 9 years, 892 (5.5%) children had 1 or more dispensations\
  \ of ADHD medication. Children whose birthing parents were admitted for delivery\
  \ just before the corticosteroid clinical cut-off of 34 + 0 weeks' gestation did\
  \ not appear to be more likely to be prescribed ADHD medication than those admitted\
  \ just after the cut-off (rate ratio 1.1, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.8 to 1.6;\
  \ 1.3 excess cases per 100 children, 95% CI -2.5 to 5.7). INTERPRETATION: We found\
  \ little evidence that children with higher probability of exposure to antenatal\
  \ corticosteroids have higher rates of ADHD prescriptions in childhood, supporting\
  \ the safety of antenatal corticosteroids for this neurodevelopmental outcome."
