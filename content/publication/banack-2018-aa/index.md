abstract: 'BACKGROUND: In cardiovascular research, pre-hospital mortality represents
  an important potential source of selection bias. Inverse probability of censoring
  weights are a method to account for this source of bias. The objective of this article
  is to examine and correct for the influence of selection bias due to pre-hospital
  mortality on the relationship between cardiovascular risk factors and all-cause
  mortality after an acute cardiac event. METHODS: The relationship between the number
  of cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors (0-5; smoking status, diabetes, hypertension,
  dyslipidemia, and obesity) and all-cause mortality was examined using data from
  the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study. To illustrate the magnitude
  of selection bias, estimates from an unweighted generalized linear model with a
  log link and binomial distribution were compared with estimates from an inverse
  probability of censoring weighted model. RESULTS: In unweighted multivariable analyses
  the estimated risk ratio for mortality ranged from 1.09 (95% confidence interval
  [CI], 0.98-1.21) for 1 CVD risk factor to 1.95 (95% CI, 1.41-2.68) for 5 CVD risk
  factors. In the inverse probability of censoring weights weighted analyses, the
  risk ratios ranged from 1.14 (95% CI, 0.94-1.39) to 4.23 (95% CI, 2.69-6.66). CONCLUSION:
  Estimates from the inverse probability of censoring weighted model were substantially
  greater than unweighted, adjusted estimates across all risk factor categories. This
  shows the magnitude of selection bias due to pre-hospital mortality and effect on
  estimates of the effect of CVD risk factors on mortality. Moreover, the results
  highlight the utility of using this method to address a common form of bias in cardiovascular
  research.'
