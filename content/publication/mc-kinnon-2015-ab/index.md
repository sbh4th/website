abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Several countries in sub-Saharan Africa have recently adopted
  policies that remove user fees for facility-based delivery services. There is little
  rigorous evidence of the impact of these policies on utilization of delivery services
  and no evaluations have examined effects on neonatal mortality rates (NMR). In this
  article, we estimate the causal effect of removing user fees on the proportion of
  births delivered in facilities, the proportion of births delivered by Caesarean
  section, and NMR. METHODS: We used data from Demographic and Health Surveys conducted
  in 10 African countries between 1997 and 2012. Kenya, Ghana and Senegal adopted
  policies removing user fees for facility-based deliveries between 2003 and 2007,
  while seven other countries not changing user fee policies were used as controls.
  We used a difference-in-differences (DD) regression approach to control for secular
  trends in the outcomes that are common across countries and for time invariant differences
  between countries. RESULTS: According to covariate-adjusted DD models, the policy
  change was consistent with an increase of 3.1 facility-based deliveries per 100
  live births (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.9, 5.2) and an estimated reduction
  of 2.9 neonatal deaths per 1000 births (95% CI: -6.8, 1.0). In relative terms, this
  corresponds to a 5% increase in facility deliveries and a 9% reduction in NMR. There
  was no evidence of an increase in Caesarean deliveries. We examined lead and lag-time
  effects, finding evidence that facility deliveries continued to increase following
  fee removal. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest removing user fees increased facility-based
  deliveries and possibly contributed to a reduction in NMR. Evidence from this evaluation
  may be useful to governments weighing the potential benefits of removing user fees.'
