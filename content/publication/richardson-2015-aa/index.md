abstract: 'OBJECTIVES: We estimated trends in drug poisoning death rates by educational
  attainment and investigated educational inequalities in drug poisoning mortality
  by race, gender, and region. METHODS: We linked drug poisoning death counts from
  the National Vital Statistics System to population denominators from the Current
  Population Survey to estimate drug poisoning rates by gender, race, region, and
  educational attainment (less than high school degree, high school degree, some college,
  college degree) from 1994 to 2010. RESULTS: There were 372,485 drug poisoning deaths.
  Education-related inequalities increased during the study among all demographic
  groups and varied by region. Absolute increases in educational inequalities were
  higher among Whites than Blacks and men than women. The age-adjusted rate difference
  between White men with less than a high school degree increased from 8.7 per 100,000
  in 1994 to 27.4 in 2010 (change = 18.7). Among Black men, the corresponding increases
  were 11.7 and 18.3, respectively (change = 6.6). CONCLUSIONS: We found strong educational
  patterning in drug poisoning rates, chiefly by region and race. Rates are highest
  and increasing the fastest among groups with less education.'
