abstract: 'The contributions of material, psychosocial, and behavioral factors in
  explaining socioeconomic inequalities in health have been explored in many Western
  studies. Most prior investigations have looked at relative abilities to explain
  such inequalities. In addition, little research focuses on Asian countries, despite
  the fact that the prevalence and socioeconomic distribution of risk factors for
  mortality are different there. This study examined relative and absolute abilities
  of material, psychosocial, and behavioral pathways to explain educational and occupational
  inequalities in mortality in a nationally representative sample from South Korea.
  The 1998 and 2001 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey data were pooled
  and linked to national mortality data. Of 8366 men and women over 30 years of age,
  310 died between 1999 and 2005. Nine pathway variables were examined: three material
  factors (income, health insurance, and car ownership status), three psychosocial
  factors (depression, stress, and marital status), and three behavioral factors (smoking,
  alcohol consumption, and physical exercise). The relative risk and relative index
  of inequality were used as measures of relative inequality, and risk differences
  and the slope index of inequality were used as measures of absolute inequality.
  Material factors explained a total of 29.0% of the excess in relative risk for education
  and 50.0% of the excess in relative risk for occupational class. Material factors
  explained 78.6% of the excess in absolute mortality difference for education and
  41.1% for occupational class. Psychosocial factors for both education and occupational
  class had a relative and absolute explanatory power of less than 15%. Behavioral
  factors showed a relative explanatory power of about 15%, but absolute explanatory
  power reached 84.0% for education and 105.4% for occupational class. However, the
  number of deaths used to calculate the absolute explanatory power was small. Results
  of this study suggest that absolute socioeconomic mortality inequalities could be
  substantially reduced if behavioral risk factors were reduced in the whole population.'
