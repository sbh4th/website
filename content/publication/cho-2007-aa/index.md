abstract: 'BACKGROUND: There is inconsistent evidence regarding the presence of a
  socioeconomic differential in adolescent all-cause and cause-specific mortality.
  This study examines possible socioeconomic mortality differentials in Korean adolescents.
  Method A total of 330 321 boys and 311 830 girls aged 10-19, who are health insurance
  beneficiaries for civil servants and private school teachers of Korean Health Insurance
  Cooperation, were followed for 9 years (1995-2003). Parental income information
  was linked to national death certificate data. RESULTS: For boys, all-cause mortality
  showed a graded inverse relationship with income level in both 10-14 year olds (RR
  = 1.64, 95% CI: 1.40-1.91) and 15-19 year olds (RR = 1.68, 95% CI: 1.40-1.91). The
  major contributor was mortality differentials from external causes, with differentials
  of transport accident death the most important. Mortality from circulatory disease
  was higher in the lowest income groups in 15-19 year olds (RR = 2.21, 95% CI: 1.09-4.50).
  A significant socioeconomic gradient of non-external cause mortality was found in
  15-19 year olds. For girls, socioeconomic differentials were less evident than boys.
  The all-cause mortality gradient for girls was smaller than for boys and only significant
  between the lowest and the highest tertile in both 10-14 year olds and 15-19 year
  olds (RR = 1.33, 95% CI: 1.02-1.72, RR = 1.38, 95% CI: 1.11-1.72, respectively).
  There were significant socioeconomic mortality differentials in all external causes
  and transport accidents and a marginally significant difference in suicide mortality
  for 10-19 year olds. Mortality from non-external causes showed no social gradient
  in girls. CONCLUSIONS: Socioeconomic differentials in all-cause mortality were observed
  in adolescents, even in early youth. This pattern might also apply to mortality
  from non-external causes, especially cardiovascular disease in 15-19 year old males.'
