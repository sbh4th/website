abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Socioeconomic inequalities are associated with oral health
  status, either subjectively (self-rated oral health) or objectively (clinically-diagnosed
  dental diseases). The aim of this study is to compare the magnitude of socioeconomic
  inequality in oral health and dental disease among adults in Australia, Canada,
  New Zealand and the United States (US). METHODS: Nationally-representative survey
  examination data were used to calculate adjusted absolute differences (AD) in prevalence
  of untreated decay and fair/poor self-rated oral health (SROH) in income and education.
  We pooled age- and gender-adjusted inequality estimates using random effects meta-analysis.
  RESULTS: New Zealand demonstrated the highest adjusted estimate for untreated decay;
  the US showed the highest adjusted prevalence of fair/poor SROH. The meta-analysis
  showed little heterogeneity across countries for the prevalence of decayed teeth;
  the pooled ADs were 19.7 (95% CI = 16.7-22.7) and 12.0 (95% CI = 8.4-15.7) between
  highest and lowest education and income groups, respectively. There was heterogeneity
  in the mean number of decayed teeth and in fair/poor SROH. New Zealand had the widest
  inequality in decay (education AD = 0.8; 95% CI = 0.4-1.2; income AD = 1.0; 95%
  CI = 0.5-1.5) and the US the widest inequality in fair/poor SROH (education AD = 40.4;
  95% CI = 35.2-45.5; income AD = 20.5; 95% CI = 13.0-27.9). CONCLUSIONS: The differences
  in estimates, and variation in the magnitude of inequality, suggest the need for
  further examining socio-cultural and contextual determinants of oral health and
  dental disease in both the included and other countries.'
