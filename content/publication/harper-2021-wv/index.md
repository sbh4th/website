abstract: In recent years, life expectancy in the United States has stagnated, followed
  by three consecutive years of decline. The decline is small in absolute terms but
  is unprecedented and has generated considerable research interest and theorizing
  about potential causes. Recent trends show that the decline has affected nearly
  all race/ethnic and gender groups, and the proximate causes of the decline are increases
  in opioid overdose deaths, suicide, homicide, and Alzheimer's disease. A slowdown
  in the long-term decline in mortality from cardiovascular diseases has also prevented
  life expectancy from improving further. Although a popular explanation for the decline
  is the cumulative decline in living standards across generations, recent trends
  suggest that distinct mechanisms for specific causes of death are more plausible
  explanations. Interventions to stem the increase in overdose deaths, reduce access
  to mechanisms that contribute to violent deaths, and decrease cardiovascular risk
  over the life course are urgently needed to improve mortality in the United States.
