abstract: 'Reduction of health inequalities within and between countries is a global
  health priority, but little is known about the determinants of popular support for
  this goal. We used data from the World Health Survey to assess individual preferences
  for prioritizing reductions in health and health care inequalities. We used descriptive
  tables and regression analysis to study the determinants of preferences for reducing
  health inequalities as the primary health system goal. Determinants included individual
  socio-demographic characteristics (age, sex, urban residence, education, marital
  status, household income, self-rated health, health care use, satisfaction with
  health care system) and country-level characteristics [gross domestic product (GDP)
  per capita, disability-free life expectancy, equality in child mortality, income
  inequality, health and public health expenditures]. We used logistic regression
  to assess the likelihood that individuals ranked minimizing inequalities first,
  and rank-ordered logistic regression to compare the ranking of other priorities
  against minimizing health inequalities. Individuals tended to prioritize health
  system goals related to overall improvement (improving population health and health
  care responsiveness) over those related to equality and fairness (minimizing inequalities
  in health and responsiveness, and promoting fairness of financial contribution).
  Individuals in countries with higher GDP per capita, life expectancy, and equality
  in child mortality were more likely to prioritize minimizing health inequalities. '
