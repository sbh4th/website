abstract: This cohort study aimed to compare the incidence of type 2 diabetes in adults
  with depression-related weight gain, depression-related weight loss, depression
  with no weight change, and no depression. The study sample included 59,315 community-dwelling
  adults in Ontario, Canada. Depression-related weight change in the past 12 months
  was measured using the Composite International Diagnostic Interview-Short Form.
  Participants were followed for up to 20 years using administrative health data.
  Cox proportional hazards models compared the incidence of type 2 diabetes in adults
  with depression-related weight change and in adults with no depression. Adults with
  depression-related weight gain had an increased risk of type 2 diabetes compared
  to adults no depression (HR 1.70, 95% CI 1.32-2.20), adults with depression-related
  weight loss (HR 1.62, 95% CI 1.09-2.42), and adults with depression with no weight
  change (HR 1.39, 95% CI 1.03-1.86). Adults with depression with no weight change
  also had an increased risk of type 2 diabetes compared to those with no depression
  (HR 1.23, 95% CI 1.04-1.45). Associations were stronger among women and persisted
  after adjusting for attained overweight and obesity. Identifying symptoms of weight
  change in depression may aid in identifying adults at higher risk of type 2 diabetes
  and in developing tailored prevention strategies.
