abstract: 'OBJECTIVES: Following the onset of intensive colonial intervention and
  rapid social change in the lives of Inuit people, youth in Nunavik have experienced
  high rates of mental health problems and suicide. Inuit people describe a broad
  range of contextual influences on mental wellness based on lived experience, but
  most epidemiological studies have focused on individual risk factors and pathologies.
  This study aimed to assess the influence of multiple determinants of mental wellness
  among Inuit youth in Nunavik, including culturally meaningful activities, housing
  and community social characteristics. METHODS: Mental wellness was measured in the
  form of two primary outcomes: self-esteem and suicidal ideation. Using cross-sectional
  data from the 2004 Nunavik Inuit Health Survey and multilevel regression modelling,
  we estimated associations between these two outcomes and various independent individual-
  and community-level explanatory factors among Inuit youth. All variables were selected
  to reflect Inuit perspectives on determinants of mental wellness. The study design
  and interpretation of results were validated with Inuit community representatives.
  RESULTS: Pride in Inuit identity, traditional activities, community-level social
  support and community-level socio-economic status were found to be protective. Barriers
  to participating in traditional activities, household crowding and high community
  rates of violence were risk factors. CONCLUSION: These findings support Inuit perspectives,
  expand the scope of epidemiological analysis of Inuit mental wellness and reinforce
  the need for locally informed, community-wide approaches to mental wellness promotion
  for Inuit youth.'
