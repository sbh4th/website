abstract: 'Nationwide differences in US life expectancy trends for blacks and whites
  may mask considerable differences by state that are relevant to policies aimed at
  reducing health inequalities. We calculated annual state-specific life expectancies
  for blacks and whites from 1990 to 2009 using age-specific mortality counts and
  census-based denominators. Nationally, the black-white difference in life expectancy
  at birth shrank during the period by 2.7 years for males (from 8.1 to 5.4 years)
  and by 1.7 years for females (from 5.5 to 3.8 years). We found considerable variation
  across states in both the magnitude of the life expectancy gap (approximately fifteen
  years) and the change during the past two decades (about six years). Decomposition
  analysis showed that New York made the most profound contribution to reducing the
  gap, but less favorable trends in a number of states, notably California and Texas,
  kept the gap from shrinking further. Large state variations in the pace of change
  in the racial gap in life expectancy suggest that state-specific determinants merit
  further investigation. '
