abstract: "BACKGROUND: Voluntary counseling and testing (VCT) is an important prevention\
  \ initiative in reducing HIV/AIDS transmission. Despite current global prevention\
  \ efforts, many low- and middle-income countries continue reporting low VCT levels.\
  \ Little is known about the association of within- and between-country socioeconomic\
  \ inequalities and VCT. Based on the 'inverse equity hypothesis,' this study examines\
  \ the degree to which low socioeconomic groups in developing countries are disadvantaged\
  \ in VCT. METHODS: Using recently released data from the 2002 to 2003 World Health\
  \ Survey (WHS) for 106 705 individuals in 49 countries, this study used multilevel\
  \ logistic regression to examine the association of individual- and national-level\
  \ factors with VCT, and whether national economic development moderated the association\
  \ between individual income and VCT. Individual income was based on country-specific\
  \ income quintiles. National economic development was based on national gross domestic\
  \ product per capita (GDP/c). Effect modification was evaluated with the likelihood\
  \ ratio test (G(2)). Individuals eligible for the VCT question of the WHS were adults\
  \ between the ages of 18-49 years; women who had given birth in the last 2 years\
  \ were excluded from this question. RESULTS: VCT was more likely among higher income\
  \ quintiles and in countries with higher GDP/c. GDP/c moderated the association\
  \ between individual income and VCT whereby relative income differences in VCT were\
  \ greater in countries with lower GDP/c (G(2)= 9.21; P= 0.002). Individual socio-demographic\
  \ characteristics were also associated with the likelihood of a person having VCT.\
  \ CONCLUSIONS: Relative socioeconomic inequalities in VCT coverage appear to decline\
  \ when higher SES groups reach a certain level of coverage. These findings suggest\
  \ that changes to international VCT programs may be necessary to moderate the relative\
  \ VCT differences between high- and low-income individuals in lower GDP/c nations."
