abstract: 'OBJECTIVES: To examine socioeconomic and health system determinants of
  wealth-related inequalities in neonatal mortality rates (NMR) across 48 low- and
  middle-income countries. METHODS: We used data from Demographic and Health Surveys
  conducted between 2006 and 2012. Absolute and relative inequalities for NMR and
  coverage of antenatal care, facility-based delivery, and Caesarean delivery were
  measured using the Slope Index of Inequality and Relative Index of Inequality, respectively.
  Meta-regression was used to assess whether variation in the magnitude of NMR inequalities
  was associated with inequalities in coverage of maternal health services, and whether
  country-level economic and health system factors were associated with mean NMR and
  socioeconomic inequality in NMR. RESULTS: Of the three maternal health service indicators
  examined, the magnitude of socioeconomic inequality in NMR was most strongly related
  to inequalities in antenatal care. NMR inequality was greatest in countries with
  higher out-of-pocket health expenditures, more doctors per capita, and a higher
  adolescent fertility rate. Determinants of lower mean NMR (e.g., higher government
  health expenditures and a greater number of nurses/midwives per capita) differed
  from factors associated with lower NMR inequality. CONCLUSIONS: Reducing the financial
  burden of maternal health services and achieving universal coverage of antenatal
  care may contribute to a reduction in socioeconomic differences in NMR. Further
  investigation of the mechanisms contributing to these cross-national associations
  seems warranted.'
