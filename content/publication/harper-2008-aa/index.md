abstract: The authors provide an overview of methods for summarizing social disparities
  in health using the example of lung cancer. They apply four measures of relative
  disparity and three measures of absolute disparity to trends in US lung cancer incidence
  by area-socioeconomic position and race-ethnicity from 1992 to 2004. Among females,
  measures of absolute and relative disparity suggested that area-socioeconomic and
  race-ethnic disparities increased over these 12 years but differed widely with respect
  to the magnitude of the change. Among males, the authors found substantial disagreement
  among summary measures of relative disparity with respect to the magnitude and the
  direction of change in disparities. Among area-socioeconomic groups, the index of
  disparity increased by 47% and the relative concentration index decreased by 116%,
  while for race-ethnicity the index of disparity increased by 36% and the Theil index
  increased by 13%. The choice of a summary measure of disparity may affect the interpretation
  of changes in health disparities. Important issues to consider are the reference
  point from which differences are measured, whether to measure disparity on the absolute
  or relative scale, and whether to weight disparity measures by population size.
  A suite of indicators is needed to provide a clear picture of health disparity change.
