abstract: "OBJECTIVES: To estimate the associations of neighbourhood walkability (based\
  \ on Geographic Information System (GIS)-derived measures of street connectivity,\
  \ land use mix, and population density and the Walk Score) with self-reported utilitarian\
  \ walking and accelerometer-assessed daily steps in Canadian adults. DESIGN: A cross-sectional\
  \ analysis of data collected as part of the Canadian Health Measures Survey (2007-2009).\
  \ SETTING: Home neighbourhoods (500 m polygonal street network buffers around the\
  \ centroid of the participant's postal code) located in Atlantic Canada, Québec,\
  \ Ontario, the Prairies and British Columbia. PARTICIPANTS: 5605 individuals participated\
  \ in the survey. 3727 adults (≥18 years) completed a computer-assisted interview\
  \ and attended a mobile clinic assessment. Analyses were based on those who had\
  \ complete exposure, outcome and covariate data (n=2949). MAIN EXPOSURE MEASURES:\
  \ GIS-derived walkability (based on land use mix, street connectivity and population\
  \ density); Walk Score. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Self-reported utilitarian walking;\
  \ accelerometer-assessed daily steps. RESULTS: No important relationship was observed\
  \ between neighbourhood walkability and daily steps. Participants who reported more\
  \ utilitarian walking, however, accumulated more steps (<1 h/week: 6613 steps/day,\
  \ 95% CI 6251 to 6975; 1 to 5 h/week: 6768 steps/day, 95% CI 6420 to 7117; ≥6 h/week:\
  \ 7391 steps/day, 95% CI 6972 to 7811). There was a positive graded association\
  \ between walkability and odds of walking ≥1 h/week for utilitarian purposes (eg,\
  \ Q4 vs Q1 of GIS-derived walkability: OR=1.66, 95% CI 1.31 to 2.11; Q3 vs Q1: OR=1.41,\
  \ 95% CI 1.14 to 1.76; Q2 vs Q1: OR=1.13, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.39) independent of age,\
  \ sex, body mass index, married/common law status, annual household income, having\
  \ children in the household, immigrant status, mood disorder, perceived health,\
  \ ever smoker and season. CONCLUSIONS: Contrary to expectations, living in more\
  \ walkable Canadian neighbourhoods was not associated with more total walking. Utilitarian\
  \ walking and daily steps were, however, correlated and walkability demonstrated\
  \ a positive graded relationship with utilitarian walking."
