abstract: 'PURPOSE: Research suggests that the Great Recession of 2007-2009 led to
  nearly 5000 excess suicides in the United States. However, prior work has not accounted
  for seasonal patterning and unique suicide trends by age and gender. METHODS: We
  calculated monthly suicide rates from 1999 to 2013 for men and women aged 15 and
  above. Suicide rates before the Great Recession were used to predict the rate during
  and after the Great Recession. Death rates for each age-gender group were modeled
  using Poisson regression with robust variance, accounting for seasonal and nonlinear
  suicide trajectories. RESULTS: There were 56,658 suicide deaths during the Great
  Recession. Age- and gender-specific suicide trends before the recession demonstrated
  clear seasonal and nonlinear trajectories. Our models predicted 57,140 expected
  suicide deaths, leading to 482 fewer observed than expected suicides (95% confidence
  interval -2079, 943). CONCLUSIONS: We found little evidence to suggest that the
  Great Recession interrupted existing trajectories of suicide rates. Suicide rates
  were already increasing before the Great Recession for middle-aged men and women.
  Future studies estimating the impact of recessions on suicide should account for
  the diverse and unique suicide trajectories of different social groups.'
