abstract: "BACKGROUND: Older adults in sub-Saharan Africa are increasingly facing\
  \ the twin challenges of reduced support from their adult children and taking on\
  \ new roles caring for orphans and vulnerable children. How these changes affect\
  \ the mental health of older adults is largely unknown. METHODS: We use data from\
  \ the 2002-2003 World Health Surveys for 15 countries in sub-Saharan Africa to examine\
  \ whether older adults who may be lacking adequate support through living alone\
  \ or in skipped-generation households are at an increased risk of depressive symptoms\
  \ compared to those living with at least one working-age adult. Using meta-regression,\
  \ we also examine whether heterogeneity across countries in the prevalence of depressive\
  \ symptoms or in the association between living arrangements and depressive symptoms\
  \ is associated with HIV/AIDS prevalence and national economic status. RESULTS:\
  \ The pooled prevalence of depressive symptoms among older adults was 9.2%. Older\
  \ adults living alone had a 2.3% point higher predicted prevalence of depressive\
  \ symptoms compared to individuals living with at least one working-age adult (95%\
  \ confidence interval: 0.2%, 4.4%). None of the country characteristics examined\
  \ explained heterogeneity across countries in the relationship between living arrangements\
  \ and depressive symptoms. However, there was some evidence suggesting a positive\
  \ association between depressive symptom prevalence and the severity of a country's\
  \ HIV/AIDS epidemic. CONCLUSION: As depressive symptoms are known to be predictive\
  \ of poor quality of life and increased mortality, it is important to address how\
  \ health and social policies can be put in place to mitigate the potentially detrimental\
  \ effects of solitary living on the mental health of older persons in sub-Saharan\
  \ Africa."
