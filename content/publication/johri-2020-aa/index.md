abstract: 'BACKGROUND: In resource-poor settings, lack of awareness and low demand
  for services constitute important barriers to expanding the coverage of effective
  interventions. In India, childhood immunization is a priority health strategy with
  suboptimal uptake. OBJECTIVE: To assess study feasibility and key implementation
  outcomes for the Tika Vaani model, a new approach to educate and empower beneficiaries
  to improve immunization and child health. METHODS: A cluster-randomized pilot trial
  with a 1:1 allocation ratio was conducted in rural Uttar Pradesh, India, from January
  to September 2018. Villages were randomly assigned to either the intervention or
  control group. In each participating village, surveyors conducted a complete enumeration
  to identify eligible households and requested participation before randomization.
  Interventions were designed through formative research using a social marketing
  approach and delivered over 3 months using strategies adapted to disadvantaged populations:
  (1) mobile health (mHealth): entertaining educational audio capsules (edutainment)
  and voice immunization reminders via mobile phone and (2) face-to-face: community
  mobilization activities, including 3 small group meetings offered to each participant.
  The control group received usual services. The main outcomes were prespecified criteria
  for feasibility of the main study (recruitment, randomization, retention, contamination,
  and adoption). Secondary endpoints tested equity of coverage and changes in intermediate
  outcomes. Statistical methods included descriptive statistics to assess feasibility,
  penalized logistic regression and ordered logistic regression to assess coverage,
  and generalized estimating equation models to assess changes in intermediate outcomes.
  RESULTS: All villages consented to participate. Gaps in administrative data hampered
  recruitment; 14.0% (79/565) of recorded households were nonresident. Only 1.4% (8/565)
  of households did not consent. A total of 387 households (184 intervention and 203
  control) with children aged 0 to 12 months in 26 villages (13 intervention and 13
  control) were included and randomized. The end line survey occurred during the flood
  season; 17.6% (68/387) of the households were absent. Contamination was less than
  1%. Participation in one or more interventions was 94.0% (173/184), 78.3% (144/184)
  for the face-to-face strategy, and 67.4% (124/184) for the mHealth strategy. Determinants
  including place of residence, mobile phone access, education, and female empowerment
  shaped intervention use; factors operated differently for face-to-face and mHealth
  strategies. For 11 of 13 intermediate outcomes, regression results showed significantly
  higher basic health knowledge among the intervention group, supporting hypothesized
  causal mechanisms. CONCLUSIONS: A future trial of a new intervention model is feasible.
  The interventions could strengthen the delivery of immunization and universal primary
  health care. Social and behavior change communication via mobile phones proved viable
  and contributed to standardization and scalability. Face-to-face interactions remain
  necessary to achieve equity and reach, suggesting the need for ongoing health system
  strengthening to accompany the introduction of communication technologies. TRIAL
