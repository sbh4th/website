abstract: 'OBJECTIVES: To assess the effect of distance to emergency obstetric and
  newborn care (EmONC) services on early neonatal mortality in rural Ethiopia and
  examine whether proximity to services contributes to socio-economic inequalities
  in early neonatal mortality. METHODS: We linked data from the 2011 Ethiopian Demographic
  and Health Survey with facility data from the 2008 Ethiopian National EmONC Needs
  Assessment based on geographical coordinates collected in both surveys. Health facilities
  were classified based on the performance of nine EmONC signal functions (e.g. neonatal
  resuscitation, Caesarean section). We used multivariable logistic regression to
  assess the relationship between distance to services and early neonatal mortality.
  A decomposition approach was used to quantify the relative contributions of distance
  to EmONC services and other determinants to overall and socio-economic inequality
  in early neonatal mortality. RESULTS: In general, closer proximity to EmONC services
  and higher level of care were associated with lower early neonatal mortality. Living
  more than 80 km from the nearest comprehensive EmONC facility able to perform all
  nine signal functions compared to living within 10 km was associated with an increase
  of 14.4 early neonatal deaths per 1000 live births (95% CI: 0.1, 28.7). Closer proximity
  to a substandard EmONC facility compared with no facility was not associated with
  lower early neonatal mortality. Distance to EmONC services was an important determinant
  of early neonatal mortality, although it did not make a significant contribution
  to explaining socio-economic inequality. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that recent
  initiatives by the Ethiopian government to improve geographical access to EmONC
  services have the potential to reduce early neonatal mortality but may not affect
  inequalities.'
