abstract: "Chile's 'health guarantees' approach to providing universal and equitable\
  \ coverage for quality healthcare in a dual public-private health system has generated\
  \ global interest. The programme, called AUGE, defines legally enforceable rights\
  \ to explicit healthcare benefits for priority health conditions, which incrementally\
  \ covered 56 problems representing 75% of the disease burden between 2005 and 2009.\
  \ It was accompanied by other health reform measures to increase public financing\
  \ and public sector planning to secure the guarantees nationwide, as well as the\
  \ state's stewardship role. We analysed data from household surveys conducted before\
  \ and after the AUGE reform to estimate changes in levels of unmet health need,\
  \ defined as the lack of a healthcare visit for a health problem occurring in the\
  \ last 30 days, by age, sex, income, education, health insurance, residence and\
  \ ethnicity; fitting logistic regression models and using predictive margins. The\
  \ overall prevalence of unmet health need was much lower in 2009 (17.6%, 95% CI:\
  \ 16.5%, 18.6%) than in 2000 (30.0%, 95% CI: 28.3%, 31.7%). Differences by income\
  \ and education extremes and rural-urban residence disappeared. In 2009, people\
  \ who had been in treatment for a condition covered by AUGE in the past year had\
  \ a lower adjusted prevalence of unmet need for their recent problem (11.7%, 95%\
  \ CI: 10.5%, 13.2%) than who had not (21.0%, 95% CI: 19.6%, 22.4%). Despite limitations\
  \ including cross-sectional and self-reported data, our findings suggest that the\
  \ Chilean health system has become more equitable and responsive to need. While\
  \ these changes cannot be directly attributed to AUGE, they were coincident with\
  \ the AUGE reforms. However, healthcare equity concerns are still present, relating\
  \ to quality of care, health system barriers and differential access for health\
  \ conditions that are not covered by AUGE. "
