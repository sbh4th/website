abstract: "PURPOSE: Life expectancy is used to measure population health, but large\
  \ differences in mortality can be masked even when there is no life expectancy gap.\
  \ We demonstrate how Arriaga's decomposition method can be used to assess inequality\
  \ in mortality between populations with near equal life expectancy. METHODS: We\
  \ calculated life expectancy at birth for Quebec and the rest of Canada from 2005\
  \ to 2009 using life tables and partitioned the gap between both populations into\
  \ age and cause-specific components using Arriaga's method. RESULTS: The life expectancy\
  \ gap between Quebec and Canada was negligible (<0.1 years). Decomposition of the\
  \ gap showed that higher lung cancer mortality in Quebec was offset by cardiovascular\
  \ mortality in the rest of Canada, resulting in identical life expectancy in both\
  \ groups. Lung cancer in Quebec had a greater impact at early ages, whereas cardiovascular\
  \ mortality in Canada had a greater impact at older ages. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the\
  \ absence of a gap, we demonstrate using decomposition analyses how lung cancer\
  \ at early ages lowered life expectancy in Quebec, whereas cardiovascular causes\
  \ at older ages lowered life expectancy in Canada. We provide SAS/Stata code and\
  \ an Excel spreadsheeet to facilitate application of Arriaga's method to other settings."
