abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Severe food insecurity (FI) is common among individuals living
  with HIV-hepatitis C virus (HCV) co-infection. We hypothesize that the injection
  of opioids is partly responsible for the association between injection drug use
  and severe FI. Therefore, this analysis examines whether methadone maintenance treatment
  for opioid dependence is associated with a lower risk of severe FI. METHODS: We
  used biannual data from the Canadian Co-infection Cohort (N = 608, 2012-2015). Methadone
  treatment (exposure) was self-reported and severe FI (outcome) was measured using
  the Household Food Security Survey Module. To quantify the association between methadone
  treatment and severe FI, we estimated an average treatment effect on the treated
  (marginal risk difference [RD]) using propensity score matching. RESULTS: Among
  participants, 25% experienced severe FI in the six months preceding the first time-point
  in the analytical sample and 5% concurrently reported receiving methadone treatment.
  Injection of opioids in the six months preceding the treatment and outcome measurements
  was much higher among those who received methadone treatment (39% vs. 12%). Among
  the treated participants, 97% had injected opioids in their lifetimes. After propensity
  score matching, the average risk of experiencing severe FI is 12.3 percentage-points
  lower among those receiving methadone treatment, compared to those who are not receiving
  treatment (marginal RD = -0.123, 95% CI = -0.230, -0.015). CONCLUSIONS: After adjustment
  for socioeconomic, sociodemographic, behavioural, and clinical confounders, methadone
  treatment is associated with a lower risk of severe FI. This finding suggests that
  methadone treatment may mitigate severe FI in this vulnerable subset of the HIV-positive
  population.'
