abstract: 'BACKGROUND: The emergence and evolution of socioeconomic inequalities in
  health involves multiple factors interacting with each other at different levels.
  Simulation models are suitable for studying such complex and dynamic systems and
  have the ability to test the impact of policy interventions in silico. OBJECTIVE:
  To explore how simulation models were used in the field of socioeconomic inequalities
  in health. METHODS: An electronic search of studies assessing socioeconomic inequalities
  in health using a simulation model was conducted. Characteristics of the simulation
  models were extracted and distinct simulation approaches were identified. As an
  illustration, a simple agent-based model of the emergence of socioeconomic differences
  in alcohol abuse was developed. RESULTS: We found 61 studies published between 1989
  and 2013. Ten different simulation approaches were identified. The agent-based model
  illustration showed that multilevel, reciprocal and indirect effects of social determinants
  on health can be modeled flexibly. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: Based on the review,
  we discuss the utility of using simulation models for studying health inequalities,
  and refer to good modeling practices for developing such models. The review and
  the simulation model example suggest that the use of simulation models may enhance
  the understanding and debate about existing and new socioeconomic inequalities of
  health frameworks.'
