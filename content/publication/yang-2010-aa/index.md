abstract: "OBJECTIVES: We assessed life expectancy increases in the past several decades\
  \ in South Korea by age and specific causes of death. METHODS: We applied Arriaga's\
  \ decomposition method to life table data (1970-2005) and mortality statistics (1983-2005)\
  \ to estimate age- and cause-specific contributions to changes in life expectancy.\
  \ RESULTS: Reductions in infant mortality made the largest age-group contribution\
  \ to the life expectancy increase. Reductions in cardiovascular diseases (particularly\
  \ stroke and hypertensive diseases) contributed most to longer life expectancy between\
  \ 1983 and 2005 (30% in males and 28% in females). Lower rates of stomach cancer,\
  \ liver disease, tuberculosis, and external-cause mortality accounted for 30% of\
  \ the male and 20% of the female increase in longevity. However, higher mortality\
  \ from ischemic heart disease, lung and bronchial cancer, colorectal cancer, breast\
  \ cancer, diabetes, and suicide offset gains by 10% in both genders. CONCLUSIONS:\
  \ Rapid increases in life expectancy in South Korea were mostly achieved by reductions\
  \ in infant mortality and in diseases related to infections and blood pressure."
