abstract: "INTRODUCTION: Targeted Regulation of Abortion Providers (TRAP) laws impose\
  \ extensive and sometimes costly requirements on abortion providers and facilities,\
  \ potentially leading to barriers to care. Understanding the impact of these laws\
  \ is important given their prevalence in the USA, but no review to date has summarised\
  \ the available evidence. We conducted a systematic review of literature on TRAP\
  \ laws and their impact on abortion trends and women's health. METHODS: We searched\
  \ MEDLINE, PubMed and EconLit for original, quantitative studies where the exposure\
  \ was at least one TRAP policy and the outcome was abortion and/or any women's physical\
  \ or mental health outcome. RESULTS: Six articles met our inclusion criteria. The\
  \ most common outcome was population-level abortion trends; studies also assessed\
  \ the effect of TRAP laws on gestational age at presentation and measures of self-perceived\
  \ burden. While certain TRAP laws (eg, admitting privilege requirements) appeared\
  \ to have an effect on abortion outcomes, the impact of other laws - or combinations\
  \ of laws - was unclear, due in part to heterogeneity between studies with respect\
  \ to study design, geography, and exposure definition. CONCLUSIONS: TRAP laws may\
  \ have an impact on the experience of obtaining an abortion in the USA. However,\
  \ our review revealed a paucity of empirical research on their population and individual-level\
  \ impact, as well as some disagreement about the effect of different TRAP laws on\
  \ subsequent abortion outcomes. Future research should prioritise the specific TRAP\
  \ laws that may have a uniquely strong effect on state-level abortion rates and\
  \ other outcomes."
