abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Neonatal mortality rates (NMRs) in countries of low and middle
  income have been only slowly decreasing; coverage of essential maternal and newborn
  health services needs to increase, particularly for disadvantaged populations. Our
  aim was to produce comparable estimates of changes in socioeconomic inequalities
  in NMR in the past two decades across these countries. METHODS: We used data from
  Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) for countries in which a survey was done in
  2008 or later and one about 10 years previously. We measured absolute inequalities
  with the slope index of inequality and relative inequalities with the relative index
  of inequality. We used an asset-based wealth index and maternal education as measures
  of socioeconomic position and summarised inequality estimates for all included countries
  with random-effects meta-analysis. FINDINGS: 24 low-income and middle-income countries
  were eligible for inclusion. In most countries, absolute and relative wealth-related
  and educational inequalities in NMR decreased between survey 1 and survey 2. In
  five countries (Cameroon, Nigeria, Malawi, Mozambique, and Uganda), the difference
  in NMR between the top and bottom of the wealth distribution was reduced by more
  than two neonatal deaths per 1000 livebirths per year. By contrast, wealth-related
  inequality increased by more than 1Â·5 neonatal deaths per 1000 livebirths per year
  in Ethiopia and Cambodia. Patterns of change in absolute and relative educational
  inequalities in NMR were similar to those of wealth-related NMR inequalities, although
  the size of educational inequalities tended to be slightly larger. INTERPRETATION:
  Socioeconomic inequality in NMR seems to have decreased in the past two decades
  in most countries of low and middle income. However, a substantial survival advantage
  remains for babies born into wealthier households with a high educational level,
  which should be considered in global efforts to further reduce NMR. FUNDING: Canadian
  Institutes of Health Research.'
