abstract: 'OBJECTIVE: To build a longitudinal state-level database on targeted regulation
  of abortion providers (TRAP) laws. DATA SOURCES: Primary sources included state
  websites, Lexis Nexis Quicklaw, and WestlawNext. We used a range of secondary sources
  to pinpoint policy timing. STUDY DESIGN: This was a state-level review of TRAP shifts
  from 1973 to present. DATA COLLECTION: We captured data on TRAP policy activity
  and timing, focusing specifically on ambulatory surgical center (ASC) laws, admitting
  privilege requirements, and transfer agreements. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Twenty-five
  states had ever enacted an ASC, admitting privilege, or transfer agreement law.
  Many currently face legal challenges. CONCLUSIONS: Targeted regulation of abortion
  providers laws are favored by many states as a way to regulate abortion provision.
  These data can be used to better understand the impact of these laws.'
