abstract: The recent housing crisis offers the opportunity to understand the effects
  of unique indicators of macroeconomic conditions on health. We linked data on the
  proportion of mortgage borrowers per US metropolitan-area who were at least 90 days
  delinquent on their payments with individual-level outcomes from a representative
  sample of 1,021,341 adults surveyed through the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance
  System (BRFSS) between 2003 and 2010. We estimated the effects of metropolitan-area
  mortgage delinquency on individual health behaviors, medical coverage, and health
  status, as well as whether effects varied by race/ethnicity. Results showed that
  increases in the metropolitan-area delinquency rate resulted in decreases in heavy
  alcohol consumption and increases in exercise and health insurance coverage. However,
  the delinquency rate was also associated with increases in smoking and obesity in
  some population groups, suggesting the housing crisis may have induced stress-related
  behavioral change. Overall, the effects of metropolitan-area mortgage delinquency
  on population health were relatively modest.
