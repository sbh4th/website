abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Associations between risk factors and perinatal outcomes may
  be biased at preterm gestational ages, if preterm delivery behaves as an effect
  modifier due to other unmeasured factors in the causal pathway. We evaluated whether
  fetuses-at-risk denominators could be used in regression models instead of conventional
  denominators to obtain less biased estimates of the association between maternal
  education and stillbirth at preterm gestational intervals. METHODS: Data included
  2,143,134 live-born and 8946 stillborn singletons from 1981 through 2006 in Québec,
  Canada. Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals were estimated for the relationship
  between education and stillbirth according to cause of fetal death, adjusting for
  maternal age, marital status, home language, parity, and period. We examined associations
  for 4 gestational intervals (<28, 28-31, 32-36, and ≥37 completed weeks), using
  both conventional denominators (ie, preterm live births) and fetuses-at-risk denominators.
  RESULTS: Stillbirth rates were greater for mothers with fewer years of education
  at all gestational intervals. Using conventional denominators, low education (relative
  to high education) was more strongly associated with term than preterm stillbirth
  and was apparently protective at <28 weeks. Using fetuses-at-risk denominators,
  low education was more strongly associated with preterm stillbirth than term stillbirth,
  even at <28 weeks. Low education was most strongly associated with diabetic-related
  stillbirth at ≥28 weeks (odds ratio = 5.04) relative to high education. CONCLUSIONS:
  Low education is associated with stillbirth throughout gestation, especially diabetic-related
  stillbirth. Use of fetuses-at-risk denominators in regression models can avoid potentially
  biased estimates obtained with conventional denominators at preterm gestational
  ages.'
