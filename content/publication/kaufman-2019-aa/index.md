abstract: "OBJECTIVES: Racial differences in mortality in the United States have narrowed\
  \ and vary by time and place. The objectives of our study were to (1) examine the\
  \ gap in life expectancy between white and black persons (hereinafter, racial gap\
  \ in life expectancy) in 4 states (California, Georgia, Illinois, and New York)\
  \ and (2) estimate trends in the contribution of major causes of death (CODs) to\
  \ the racial gap in life expectancy by age group. METHODS: We extracted data on\
  \ the number of deaths and population sizes for 1969-2013 by state, sex, race, age\
  \ group, and 6 major CODs. We used a Bayesian time-series model to smooth and impute\
  \ mortality rates and decomposition methods to estimate trends in sex- and age-specific\
  \ contributions of CODs to the racial gap in life expectancy. RESULTS: The racial\
  \ gap in life expectancy at birth decreased in all 4 states, especially among men\
  \ in New York (from 8.8 to 1.1 years) and women in Georgia (from 8.0 to 1.7 years).\
  \ Although few deaths occurred among persons aged 1-39, racial differences in mortality\
  \ at these ages (mostly from injuries and infant mortality) contributed to the racial\
  \ gap in life expectancy, especially among men in California (1.0 year of the 4.3-year\
  \ difference in 2013) and Illinois (1.9 years of the 6.7-year difference in 2013).\
  \ Cardiovascular deaths contributed most to the racial gap in life expectancy for\
  \ adults aged 40-64, but contributions decreased among women aged 40-64, especially\
  \ in Georgia (from 2.8 to 0.5 years). The contribution of cancer deaths to inequality\
  \ increased in California and Illinois, whereas New York had the greatest reductions\
  \ in inequality attributable to cancer deaths (from 0.6 to 0.2 years among men and\
  \ from 0.2 to 0 years among women). CONCLUSIONS: Future research should identify\
  \ policy innovations and economic changes at the state level to better understand\
  \ New York's success, which may help other states emulate its performance."
