  abstract = {We examined the concordance of income inequality trends with 30-year US regional trends in cause-specific mortality and 100-year trends in heart disease and infant mortality. The evidence suggests that any links between income inequality and population health trends is likely to be complex. The descriptive findings here imply that income inequality would have to be linked and de-linked across different time periods, with different exposures to generate the observed heterogeneous regional and national levels and trends in different causes of death. {\copyright} 2004 Max-Planck-Gesellschaft.},
