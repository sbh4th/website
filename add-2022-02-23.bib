	abstract = {In recent years, life expectancy in the United States has stagnated, followed by three consecutive years of decline. The decline is small in absolute terms but is unprecedented and has generated considerable research interest and theorizing about potential causes. Recent trends show that the decline has affected nearly all race/ethnic and gender groups, and the proximate causes of the decline are increases in opioid overdose deaths, suicide, homicide, and Alzheimer's disease. A slowdown in the long-term decline in mortality from cardiovascular diseases has also prevented life expectancy from improving further. Although a popular explanation for the decline is the cumulative decline in living standards across generations, recent trends suggest that distinct mechanisms for specific causes of death are more plausible explanations. Interventions to stem the increase in overdose deaths, reduce access to mechanisms that contribute to violent deaths, and decrease cardiovascular risk over the life course are urgently needed to improve mortality in the United States.},

@article{Graham:2021wh,
	abstract = {This cohort study aimed to compare the incidence of type 2 diabetes in adults with depression-related weight gain, depression-related weight loss, depression with no weight change, and no depression. The study sample included 59,315 community-dwelling adults in Ontario, Canada. Depression-related weight change in the past 12 months was measured using the Composite International Diagnostic Interview-Short Form. Participants were followed for up to 20 years using administrative health data. Cox proportional hazards models compared the incidence of type 2 diabetes in adults with depression-related weight change and in adults with no depression. Adults with depression-related weight gain had an increased risk of type 2 diabetes compared to adults no depression (HR 1.70, 95% CI 1.32-2.20), adults with depression-related weight loss (HR 1.62, 95% CI 1.09-2.42), and adults with depression with no weight change (HR 1.39, 95% CI 1.03-1.86). Adults with depression with no weight change also had an increased risk of type 2 diabetes compared to those with no depression (HR 1.23, 95% CI 1.04-1.45). Associations were stronger among women and persisted after adjusting for attained overweight and obesity. Identifying symptoms of weight change in depression may aid in identifying adults at higher risk of type 2 diabetes and in developing tailored prevention strategies.},

@article{Carabali:2022wh,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: We used surveillance data from Brazil and Colombia during 2007-2017 to assess the presence of socioeconomic inequalities on dengue, chikungunya and Zika at the neighborhood level in two Latin American cities.
METHODS: To quantify the inequality, we estimated and decomposed the relative concentration index of inequality (RCI) accounting for the spatiotemporal distribution of the diseases.
RESULTS: There were 281 426 arboviral cases notified in Fortaleza, Brazil, and 40 889 in Medellin, Colombia. The RCI indicated greater concentration of dengue cases among people living in low socioeconomic settings in both sites. The RCIs for chikungunya in Fortaleza covered the line of equality during their introduction in 2014, while the RCIs for Zika and chikungunya in Medellin indicated the presence of a small inequality. The RCI decomposition showed that year of notification and age were the main contributors to this inequality. In Medellin, the RCI decomposition showed that age and access to waste management accounted for 75.5%, 72.2% and 54.5% of the overall inequality towards the poor for dengue, chikungunya and Zika, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study presents estimates of the socioeconomic inequality of arboviruses and its decomposition in two Latin American cities. We corroborate the concentration of arboviral diseases in low socioeconomic neighborhoods and identify that year of occurrence, age, presence of healthcare facilities and waste management are key determinants of the heterogenous distribution of endemic arboviruses across the socioeconomic spectrum.},
